<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">ASHTON-KIRK is a young man of means
and position. The unusual has a sort of
fascination for him; his subtle perception,
and keen, direct habit of mind cause him to delight
in the investigation of those crimes which
have proved too shadowy for the police.</p>

<p>In &#8220;Ashton-Kirk, Investigator,&#8221; another book
dealing with his experiences, he was concerned
with the strange case of the murder of the numismatist,
Hume. In &#8220;Secret Agent,&#8221; he was involved
in a crisis between two nations; and a
great war was averted by his skill and ready
courage.</p>

<p>In this volume, he is called upon by an ancient
friend who has been plunged into an appalling series
of circumstances of which he can make nothing,
except that all concerned are in immediate and
deadly peril. And it is here shown how the
special detective&#8217;s acute mind, deft manipulation
and resourcefulness warded off a terrible danger.</p>

<small>MR. SCANLON RELATES SOME PECULIAR
CIRCUMSTANCES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ASHTON-KIRK, student of crime, sat cross-legged
upon a rug; thoughtfully he drew
at the big pipe; the wreaths of smoke
drifted over the tottering towers of books with
which he was surrounded, and eddied out at an
open window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fuller,&#8221; said he, &#8220;get me the name Campe.&#8221;</p>

<p>The nimble fingered assistant ran through the
cards of a filing system.</p>

<p>&#8220;Campe&mdash;Mexico&mdash;financiers?&#8221; said he, at
length, turning his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; spoke Ashton-Kirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Volume II,&#8221; said Fuller, closing the drawer.
&#8220;Shall I have it sent up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few moments, Stumph, gravest of men
servants, entered, bearing a bulky folio which he
placed before his employer.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a short time,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk, &#8220;Mr.
Scanlon will call. Bring him up as soon as he
arrives.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stumph silently withdrew; the special detective
puffed at the meerschaum and nodded to Fuller.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see what we have about the Campes,&#8221;
requested he.</p>

<p>Fuller took the book, opened it at the index,
and then turned over until he came to a certain
page. He read:</p>

<p>&#8220;This family came, originally, from Bavaria,
their forbears residing in the city of Munich. The
name was then Von Campe. A Frederich Ernest
Von Campe made a fortune as a brewer before the
French Revolution. His three sons trebled this
by lending it at a high rate of interest to the various
needy German states during the Napoleonic
wars.</p>

<p>&#8220;When Maximilian entered Mexico, the Von
Campes helped to finance the venture. When he
fell, they very cleverly managed to save their
money by coming to an understanding with the
succeeding republican government. For more
than fifty years the family has been in Mexico,
financing government and private enterprises.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some twenty-five years ago they dropped the
&#8216;Von,&#8217; becoming simply known as Campe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fuller then went on to read the doings of the
Campes as contained in the record; it was merely
a series of &#8220;high spots&#8221; such as might be gathered
about a family of the same consequence anywhere.
When he had finished, Ashton-Kirk
looked dissatisfied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I find, from time to time,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that this
record is badly kept. It is loaded with the usual,
when, as a matter of fact, it is intended solely for
the unusual.&#8221; He drew at his pipe for a moment,
and then added: &#8220;I want intimate information
regarding this family&mdash;especially of their
doings during the last few years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Fuller, briskly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll start<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
with the Mexican-Pacific Bank. They ought
to know a deal about the Campes because they did
a lot of business with them, according to what we
have here.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Fuller opened the door to leave the study,
Stumph appeared with a big, fresh-faced man
who clutched a hard-rimmed hat in his nervous
grip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Scanlon,&#8221; said Stumph; and then he
followed Fuller out of the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to see you, Kirk,&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon, in a
voice which suited his proportions. &#8220;I hope I
haven&#8217;t come butting in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it,&#8221; the crime student assured
him. &#8220;Here, have a chair; also have a cigar.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Scanlon sat in the chair, and pinched the
tip off the cigar. He had blue, good-natured eyes,
the sort accustomed to laugh; but now they were
grave enough, and little troubled wrinkles showed
at their corners.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look up to your ears in work,&#8221; said he,
his eyes upon the books.</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, I&#8217;ve been resting,&#8221; he answered,
his gaze also upon the books, and filled
with the mist which comes of deep plunges into
the past, or into the annals of lands that never
were. &#8220;When I&#8217;m overtaxed or too tightly
strung there&#8217;s nothing so relaxes me as the ancient
romances; there&#8217;s nothing near so quieting as the
sayings of the wise old monks, spoken in the cool
of the cloisters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Scanlon nodded appreciatively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Personally, I&#8217;m very strong for all those old
fellows,&#8221; said he. &#8220;They had speed, control
and change of pace.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>&#8220;Their greatest charm is their simplicity,&#8221; said
Ashton-Kirk, as he refilled his pipe. &#8220;They believed
things as children believe them. Their days
were rare with faith; their nights with wonders.
But,&#8221; and there was regret in the speaker&#8217;s voice,
&#8220;the world has turned many times since then.
There are no more wonders; and surprise, as they
knew it, has ceased to exist.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Bat Scanlon, one time athlete and gambler,
but now a handler of champions, brushed the
first short plume of ash from his cigar. He shook
his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wrong!&#8221; stated he, confidently. &#8220;Altogether
wrong. You get behind the scenes too
much; you see the insides of things too often.
Wonder is as thick as ever it was; and surprise is
still on the job. If there&#8217;s any falling off, it&#8217;s in
ourselves. We&#8217;ve grown cross-eyed looking at
fakes; we haven&#8217;t the vision to know a wonder
when we see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>A volume of Burton lay upon the table at his
hand. He picked it up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s Bagdad,&#8221; said he, riffling the pages,
sharply. &#8220;Bagdad, a city stuffed with strangeness.
But,&#8221; and he looked at Ashton-Kirk,
earnestly, &#8220;had it really anything on this town
of ours? Were its nights deeper? its silences
more mysterious? I think not. Let any man&mdash;with
his eyes open&mdash;mind you&mdash;go out into one
of our nights, and he&#8217;ll meet with as many astonishments
as Haroun Al Raschid, the best prowler
of them all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk smiled through the thickening
smoke. It were as though he had convinced
himself of something.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your defence of present day interests is so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
keen,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that I&#8217;m inclined to hope this
case you have holds some exceptional features.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scanlon nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; with a gesture, &#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure.
I can&#8217;t put my fingers on a single thing, or even
give it a name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has something to do with this young fellow
Campe, I think you said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has all to do with him,&#8221; stated Mr. Scanlon.
&#8220;And that&#8217;s one of the things that makes it so
queer. He&#8217;s the last one I&#8217;d expected to get
mixed up with anything of the kind; and he&#8217;s a
gone youngster if somebody with more stuff
than I have don&#8217;t step in and take a swing at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a short silence; the smoke from the
cigar mingled with that of the pipe; eddying in
the draught from the window they wove in and
out intricately, finally mingled and drifted out
into the big world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you go carefully over the affair as
you know it,&#8221; suggested Ashton-Kirk. &#8220;I got
very little of it over the telephone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scanlon drew at the cigar and gazed at the opposite
wall where there hung that Maxfield Parrish
print of the wonder-stricken brown sailors, peering
into the unknown from the bow of their ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;If this was my own matter,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I
could take every individual happening by the
neck and shake the information right out of it.
But as it stands, I&#8217;ve only got a good straight look
at one thing that&#8217;s at all plain to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Ashton-Kirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fear,&#8221; replied Scanlon, in a low-pitched voice,
his mouth twisting wrily as he shaped the word.
&#8220;Stark, white-faced fear; the kind that turns a
man sick just at the sight of it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>The big man frowned for a moment at the brown
sailors peering out over their mystic sea. Then
he resumed.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I said a few moments ago, I was surprised
at a young fellow like Campe indulging in a
recreation like being afraid; for in him we have
a wide-awake chap, graduate of one of the big
colleges, holder of a middle distance record and
known for his pluck. And for such a one to lock
himself up in a big country house and go to shaking
at every sound he hears is not quite pleasant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fear, when properly planted, sinks deep and
lasts long,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen strong
men quite like rabbits, in the grip of something
they didn&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got acquainted with young Campe a couple
of years ago when he sprung a tendon and they
thought a big race was lost for his college. They
sent for me as old Doc. Emergency and I tinkered
him up enough to go the distance. After that he
got friendly. When he graduated, every one expected
he&#8217;d go back to Mexico. But he didn&#8217;t.
He went into a German importing house here&mdash;a
kind of partner, I think.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d always taken him for a casual kind of
chap; he never seemed to take things very seriously,
and had a very frequent laugh. But about
a year ago I noticed a change. He didn&#8217;t talk so
much; if he laughed at all it didn&#8217;t have the old-time
colour; and he got to sitting staring at the
ground. When I&#8217;d talk, he&#8217;d listen for a while;
then he&#8217;d sort of drift away. I could tell by his
expression that he wasn&#8217;t getting a thing I was
saying. Finally he took to walking the floor,
biting his nails and whispering to himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk shook his head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>&#8220;Pretty bad,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I thought. And I mentioned the
fact to him. But he tried to laugh&mdash;it was a complete
failure&mdash;and said there was nothing wrong.
He was a little nervous; and even that, so he
said, would wear off after a while.</p>

<p>&#8220;The day I spoke to him in this way was the
last I saw of him until about two weeks ago.
Then I got a letter, asking me to pack a bag and
run up to Marlowe Furnace for a visit. &#8216;The
shooting&#8217;s good,&#8217; says he, &#8216;and I&#8217;ve got a brace
of dogs that&#8217;ll give you some excitement.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;This,&#8217; says I, to myself, &#8216;is just about the
right thing. Nothing&#8217;d suit me better now than
to fuss with a dog and a gun.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I wrote him I&#8217;d come at once. Marlowe
Furnace, if you don&#8217;t know the place, is about
twenty miles out, tucked away among the hills.
It was quite a place in revolutionary times; they
beat out sword blades and bayonets there, and
cast cannon, and the round shot to stuff them
with.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only a few houses, with an inn for
summer visitors; and there&#8217;s a little covered
bridge crosses the river, just like a picture on a
plate. Campe was holding out at Schwartzberg,
or Castle Schwartzberg, as the people of the town
call it. The castle is a regular robber-baron kind
of a place, with a wall around it, towers, battlements,
little windows with heavy bars, and all the
rest of the fixings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk. &#8220;It was
built by a German officer who came over with
Baron Steuben during the Revolution. When
peace came, he decided he liked the section well
enough to stay. He was rich, and built Schwartzberg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
in the effort to get some of the colour of the
old land into the new.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was something like that,&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon,
nodding. &#8220;And the builder must have been related,
in a way, to the Campes. Anyhow, they
came into the castle some years ago. Well, to be
invited to a place like that was not usual with
me; and I felt a little swelled up about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You&#8217;ve been asked because of your qualities
as a sportsman and boon companion,&#8217; says I to
myself; &#8216;the discriminating always pick you for
an ace.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;But twenty-four hours later I had learned my
true status,&#8221; said Scanlon, his brows corrugating,
and his thick forefinger tapping the table. &#8220;I
had been asked to Schwartzberg to act as a body-guard,
and for nothing else in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind you, the situation has never been put
into plain words. In fact, it&#8217;s never been even
hinted at. But things happened, queer things,
with no meanings attached, and so I gradually
understood. A body-guard I was; and my job
was to protect young Campe from something out
among the hills.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>SHOWS HOW MATTERS STOOD AT SCHWARTZBERG</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SCANLON paused for a space; he examined
a loose place in the wrapper of his cigar,
while Ashton-Kirk sat waiting, upon his
rug, his hands clasping his knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I first grabbed at this fact,&#8221; said the
big man at length, &#8220;I gave it a good looking-over.
But I kept still, mind you; I said no more
than the folks at the castle&mdash;and they were saying
nothing at all. I tackled the thing from every
angle, but nothing come out of it. And yet, all
the time, young Campe shivered; and, somehow,
I felt that he had cause to do so. I could feel the
thing, whatever it was, at every turn, in every
shadow, in every sound.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The condition of Campe probably had its
effect upon you,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk. &#8220;He communicated
his state of mind to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In other words,&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon, &#8220;I was
stuck full of suggestion. Well, don&#8217;t burden
yourself with that notion any longer. I&#8217;ve had
some brisk experiences of my own from time to
time; and a man with a murky past doesn&#8217;t go
in for mental influences, not even a little bit. But
be that as it may, I hadn&#8217;t been at Schwartzberg
five days before I, too, began to feel like sending
out an S.O.S. for help. And now, in a little more
than twice that time, I come knocking at your
door and urging you to do something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I get a general atmosphere of fear&mdash;of an impending
something&mdash;of an invisible danger,&#8221; said
Ashton-Kirk. &#8220;But there&#8217;s nothing in what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
you&#8217;ve told me which permits of a hand-grip, so
to speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you,&#8221; began Scanlon, &#8220;there isn&#8217;t a
single thing which&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t expect anything definite,&#8221; said the
special detective. &#8220;Give me the details of your
stay at Schwartzberg. Perhaps we can draw
something from those.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon. &#8220;Well, as soon
as I put my foot on the station platform at Marlowe
Furnace, the thing began. The station man
said to me:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You going to Schwartzberg?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes,&#8217; says I.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;A party&#8217;s been asking about you,&#8217; says he.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;One of Campe&#8217;s people, I suppose.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No,&#8217; says he. &#8216;I know all them. The party
was a stranger.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought this a little queer, but I had my
getting out to Campe&#8217;s place to think of; and as
it was late and very dark, I said nothing more
except to ask my way.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Take the road down to the river,&#8217; says the
station man. &#8216;Then cross the bridge and turn to
your right. You&#8217;ll see a lot of lights that look as
if they were hanging away up in the air. That&#8217;s
the castle.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, bag in hand, I started off. It was a
starry night; but there was no moon and starlight
isn&#8217;t much good on a road where the tree
branches meet on either side. But I was in the
right direction and in a little while I made out the
outlines of the covered bridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Like a Noah&#8217;s Ark,&#8217; says I, as I started
across. Footsteps inside covered bridges on a
still, dark night are apt to stir up a lot of other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
sounds; so when I began to hear a kind of shuffling
alongside of me, I wasn&#8217;t surprised. &#8216;An
echo,&#8217; says I, and didn&#8217;t even turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;But when an electric hand torch shot a little
tunnel of light through the darkness and hit me
in the ear, I came about, quick enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I ask your pardon,&#8217; says a smooth kind of a
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;That I grant you, willingly,&#8217; says I. &#8216;But,
believe me, friend, you&#8217;ll have to be sharp to get
anything else.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The worst of an electric torch in a dark place,&#8221;
complained Mr. Scanlon, &#8220;is that the party holding
it has a good sight of you; but all you can do
to him is wink and look foolish. These being the
conditions I didn&#8217;t lash out at the party as I felt
like doing, not knowing just what he was; so I
waited for him to show his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You are on your way to Schwartzberg, I
think,&#8217; says the voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;On my way is right,&#8217; says I, as confidently
as I could. &#8216;And I count on getting there all
safe and sound.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The party with the torch appeared to be
tickled at this; for he began to chuckle.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m very fortunate in meeting you,&#8217; says he.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Good,&#8217; says I. &#8216;I always like to find people
in luck. And now, if it&#8217;s no trouble, suppose
you explain your reason for stopping me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Of course,&#8217; says he. &#8216;To be sure. I&#8217;ve a
small favour to ask of you,&#8217; he says. &#8216;If you&#8217;ll
be so kind, I&#8217;ll have you carry this to young
Mr. Campe.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And like that,&#8221; here Scanlon snapped his
fingers, &#8220;the light went out, and I felt the party
put something into my hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>&#8220;&#8216;No explanation will be needed,&#8217; says the
voice, if anything a little smoother than before.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What I have given you will tell its own story.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I heard the pit-pit-pat of careful feet
going back across the bridge. I waited for a
little to see if there was to be anything further;
but as there wasn&#8217;t I put the thing the stranger
had given me into my pocket, and took up the
journey once more. At the end of the bridge I
looked up the river; there was a sort of mist lifting
from the water, but high above this a battery of
lights twinkled and blinked in the distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;If that&#8217;s Schwartzberg,&#8217; says I, &#8216;Campe&#8217;s
got her well lit up.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I struck along a road which led over the hills;
and in half an hour I was thumping at the gate of
the castle.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a little empty space after my
knock,&#8221; said Scanlon. &#8220;Then I heard footsteps
and the sound of whispering. Suddenly I was
flooded by a light from somewhere over the gate;
I heard a man mention my name in a kind of a
shout; then the gate opened, I was dragged in,
and it swung shut after me, the bolts and things
falling into place with a great racket. Young
Campe had me by the hand and was shaking away
for dear life.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m glad to see you, old chap!&#8217; says he.
&#8216;Glad as I can be. But I never expected you on
a train as late as this!&#8217; He left off shaking my
hand and took to slapping my back; it all seemed
feverish to me; but like a dud, I took it all for
just plain delight in seeing me. &#8216;You see,&#8217; says
he, &#8216;it&#8217;s a pretty quiet kind of a place out here;
and when you came a-knocking, we couldn&#8217;t
imagine who it could be.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>&#8220;After which,&#8221; continued Mr. Scanlon, &#8220;I was
led across a courtyard and through a high narrow
doorway like a slit in the wall. A few steps
down a stone paved corridor and we turned into a
room that was a ringer for Weisebrode&#8217;s Rathskellar.
And while I was looking around at the
place, Campe went on talking as if he&#8217;d never
stop. This wasn&#8217;t usual, and as I now had a good
view of him under the light, I noticed that he was
pinched looking; there were hollows in his face
and neck that I&#8217;d never seen there before.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well,&#8217; says he, &#8216;here you are, old man, and
there never was a person so welcome anywhere
before. You see,&#8217; and his voice sank a little,
&#8216;there&#8217;s been things about here that&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Take care,&#8217; says some one. And as I looked
around I saw a short, blocky German standing
beside us, his hand at a salute. He was sort of
grey around the temples and he had as grim a
face as I ever saw.</p>

<p>&#8220;Young Campe gave a sort of gulp. &#8216;Quite
right, sergeant,&#8217; says he. Then, to me, he goes
on: &#8216;This is Sergeant-Major Kretz, once of the
Kaiser&#8217;s army, and an old friend of my father&#8217;s.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sergeant-major saluted once more, but
his face was like granite.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I will take your hat and coat,&#8217; says he; and
then a thing happened which, for suddenness, has
got anything I ever saw licked to a standstill;
and I&#8217;ve seen some sudden doings in my day. I
pulled off my overcoat and gave it to the sergeant-major.
He took it kind of awkwardly; something
dropped from one of the pockets and slid
across the sanded floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Don&#8217;t be so confoundedly clumsy, Kretz,&#8217;
says Campe, and he stooped and picked the thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
up. But when he got it in his hands and gave it
one look, he threw it from him and gave a gurgling
sort of cry. Then he swung around and
leaped on me like a madman, both hands digging
into my throat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk shook the ash from the meerschaum
and nodded at his visitor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather impulsive,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>The big man&#8217;s hand caressed his throat; it was
as though he still felt the clasp of the young fellow&#8217;s
fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was no easy job tearing him loose,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;He stuck to me like a wildcat; his intention was
to do for me on the spot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the thing that set him off?&#8221; asked
the crime specialist.</p>

<p>&#8220;After I&#8217;d got him into a chair with the sergeant-major
holding him,&#8221; answered Scanlon, &#8220;I
had a look at it. It was a smooth stone about the
size of an egg, though not that shape, green in
colour, and with a humped up place on one side
of it. I had no recollection of ever having seen it
before, and I was puzzled about how it got into
my pocket. But while I was puzzling, it flashed
on me.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s the thing that fellow gave me while I
was crossing the bridge,&#8217; says I.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let me up,&#8217; says young Campe to the German.
There was something nearer sanity in his
eyes than there had been a few moments before;
so the sergeant-major let go of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What fellow?&#8217; says Campe.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I didn&#8217;t know him; it was dark and I didn&#8217;t
even see him. He spoke to me on the bridge
coming from the station. He gave me this thing
for you. He said you&#8217;d ask no questions, but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
didn&#8217;t mention,&#8217; I couldn&#8217;t help adding, &#8216;the
other thing you&#8217;d do.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Campe grabbed my arm with both hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;If you can,&#8217; says he, &#8216;try and forget that I
lost my head just now. If you knew what a
bedeviled man I am, you&#8217;d only wonder why I
don&#8217;t go permanently mad.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he stood looking at the green stone,
which the sergeant-major had put upon the table;
his lips twitched, his face was white.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, they are cunning,&#8217; says he. &#8216;They know
the nature and substance of fear. They play
upon it with the expertness of devils. But,&#8217; and
he lifted one clenched fist, &#8216;they&#8217;ll never break
my nerve; I&#8217;ll hold out against them, no matter
what they do.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was pretty direct,&#8221; spoke Ashton-Kirk.
&#8220;What followed? Did he say anything more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The German sergeant-major took him away
before he could indulge in any further remarks;
I didn&#8217;t see him again until next morning; and
then nothing at all was said about the doings of
the night. A couple of times I was on the point
of asking him to put me up in the reason for his
goings on; but something in his manner and
expression kept me back.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the late afternoon we all went out for a
breather among the hills. But it was more like
an expedition into the enemy&#8217;s country than an
exercise. They put a couple of Colt automatics
in my pocket, and each of them took one. Also
the sergeant-major carried a Mauser rifle with
kick enough to have killed at a couple of
miles.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Sometimes there are vagrants who get impudent,&#8217;
said Campe. &#8216;I&#8217;ve known them to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
attempt robbery; so we may as well be prepared.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Next day we took the dogs and guns and tried
for some birds; at night we locked the place
up like a prison. The days that followed were
about the same; I never felt so thick a depression
anywhere as there was in Schwartzberg. For
hours no one would speak; our meals would go
through like a funeral rite; sometimes I&#8217;d catch
myself chewing my food to the tune of a dead
march. After dinner we&#8217;d have a gloomy game
of cards; at about ten we&#8217;d all go off to bed, one
by one, and seem glad to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your first visit wasn&#8217;t pleasant,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got no fun out of it except the tramping
around, and then only when I&#8217;d go off by myself.
I&#8217;d have cleared out as soon as I&#8217;d sized matters
up, but there were two things kept me back.
First, I like young Campe, and I wanted to help
him out; second, something was doing of a
piquant nature, and I had a curiosity to know
what it was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Several times, from my bedroom windows, I
saw Kretz prowling about the courtyard or upon
the wall. Once I fancied I caught the creeping of
a couple of figures beyond the wall. I went out
to look up the nature of the stunt, and almost got
myself shot by what Campe afterward called
prowling tramps. On the following night as I sat
reading in my room, I heard a woman&#8217;s scream&mdash;sudden
and high with fear. There was a rush of
feet along empty corridors, sharp voices and the
slamming of doors. I grabbed up my automatic
and, all in disarray, I broke for the scene of excitement.
But half-way down a flight of stairs I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
came upon Sergeant-Major Kretz, quite calm, but
looking a little grimmer, if anything, than I&#8217;d
ever seen him before.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s nothing,&#8217; he tells me. &#8216;The Fr&auml;ulein
was frightened. All is right. You need not
bother.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a woman, then, at Schwartzberg?&#8221;
said Ashton-Kirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two of them, to be exact,&#8221; returned Scanlon.
&#8220;One&#8217;s an aunt of Campe&#8217;s; the other is a companion,
or something of the kind. The girl I see
often, but the aunt very rarely. But I never did
more than nod to either of them until the night
Campe was cut.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the body,&#8221; said Scanlon. &#8220;That was two
nights ago. I had gone to bed rather later than
usual and had, I think, been asleep only a few
minutes when I was awakened by a sound. I sat
up and listened. Then it came again. Far off, as
though among the hills, came a roaring; it started
like a murmur at first, and grew in volume until
it rumbled like nothing I&#8217;d ever heard before.
Then it died away, and only its echo remained,
drifting above the hillsides.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Thunder,&#8217; says I.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the sky was filled with stars, and they
shone as brilliantly as stars ever shone before.
Once more came the roaring in the night; with
my head thrust far out at the window, I listened.
A door opening on the courtyard slapped to, suddenly;
quick footsteps sounded and Campe&#8217;s voice,
high and angry, came to my ears. The gate
opened before him; I could see him, a revolver
in his hand and with all the appearance of madness,
rush away in the direction of the great sound.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>&#8220;I commenced jumping into my clothes, a
garment at a jump; a brilliant tongue of light
shot from the top of Schwartzberg, and began to
sweep the country round about much like the
searchlight of a battleship.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;They are strong on equipment,&#8217; says I to myself,
as I grabbed my gun and made for the door.
This time I met no one on the stairs, nor in the
courtyard, when I reached it, nor yet at the gate.
Once outside I looked up; the light was streaming
out over the hills from the tallest turret of the
castle; and in the gloom beside the reflector I saw
Kretz, his Mauser in his hands, his face turned as
though he were grimly picking up each detail as
the light brought it out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had noted the direction which Campe had
taken; so I struck after him. Two hundred
yards away from the castle I heard his revolver
begin to speak; then there came the eager straining
breaths of men engaged in a struggle, the
grinding of feet, and a heavy fall. I had all but
reached the spot when the great ray swept round
and held fast. I saw young Campe stretched out
upon the ground; and over him stood the girl,
all in white, with her face upturned, her arms
outstretched toward the high turret as though
imploring the grim rifleman to hold his fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; asked Ashton-Kirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;She was a peach; and Campe was nearly
done. I lifted him, and with my automatic held
ready, and the girl trailing behind, I got back to
the castle where I heard the gate closed and
locked behind me with some thankfulness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was Campe badly hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He had a long, peculiar cut down his chest
and stomach, not deep, but ugly looking. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
just as though some one had made a sweep at
him with something big and heavy and keen, and
he had pulled back in time to escape most of it.
But he was about next day; he thanked me for
going out after him, but would explain nothing.
It was after this that I tried to reason it out for
the last time. But it&#8217;s no use&mdash;the thing&#8217;s beyond
yours truly. So here I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>The singular eyes of Ashton-Kirk were full of
interest; he arose from his rug and took a couple
of turns up and down the room; then he threw
open a bulky railroad guide and his searching
finger began to run in and out among the figures.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a train for Marlowe Furnace at 8.4,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>Then he pressed one of a series of bells in the
wall, and, through a tube, said to some one below:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have dinner half an hour earlier. And set
places for two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d jump into the thing with
any such speed as this,&#8221; remarked Mr. Scanlon,
highly gratified.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks like a case which will admit of no
delay,&#8221; replied Ashton-Kirk. &#8220;Something of a
deadly nature is lowering over Schwartzberg;
that&#8217;s plain enough. And that young Campe is
so secretive about it is an indication that it&#8217;s one
of those things which cannot well be spoken of
to the police.&#8221;</p>

<small>IN WHICH THE SPECIAL DETECTIVE TAKES UP THE
HUNT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER dinner, Ashton-Kirk smoked a cigar
with his friend; then he retired to dress
for the journey to Marlowe Furnace.
When he reappeared he wore a rough, well-fitting
grey suit, a grey flannel shirt, a cloth cap and a
pair of springy tan shoes. In his hand he held a
heavy hickory stick, which he balanced like a
swordsman.</p>

<p>&#8220;You looked primed for work,&#8221; approved Bat
Scanlon, as he stood up and buttoned his coat
across his big chest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your story of the doings in and about
Schwartzberg holds out a promise of entertainment,&#8221;
smiled Ashton-Kirk. &#8220;And I&#8217;ve noticed
that things of that sort are always more appreciated
if they are prepared for and met half-way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; praised Mr. Scanlon, who was in
high good humour at his success in gaining the
interest of the specialist in the unusual. &#8220;Fine!
That&#8217;s the kind of talk I like to hear. It puts a
man somewhere. Locking himself up and shivering
never got anybody anything yet. And then
going mad and rushing out to have unseen parties
chop at him is even worse. When I taught boxing
to the boys out at Shaweegan College I used to
hand them this advice: &#8216;Always keep after your
man&mdash;don&#8217;t let him get settled. And the best
guard for a blow is another blow&mdash;started
sooner.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent,&#8221; agreed Ashton-Kirk. &#8220;And it&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
a thousand pities you didn&#8217;t impress it upon young
Campe. If you had, he&#8217;d never have been in his
present state of mind and body.&#8221;</p>

<p>The huge shoulders of Scanlon shrugged in
disbelief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Campe was past all reason when I got to
him,&#8221; maintained he. &#8220;To talk candidly would
only have spoilt any chance I had of doing him a
good turn.&#8221;</p>

<p>The 8.4 was a dusty ill-kept train, which
started and stopped with a series of jerks. After
an hour on board of it, among a lot of uncomfortable,
sour-looking passengers, the two got off
at Marlowe Furnace. The station was a shed-like
structure with a platform of hard-packed
earth, and a brace of flaring oil lamps. An ancient,
with a wisp of beard and thumbs tucked
under a pair of braces, watched them get off.</p>

<p>&#8220;The station agent,&#8221; said Scanlon.</p>

<p>The train went panting and glaring away into
the darkness; it had disappeared around a bend
when the station official nodded to Scanlon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Evening,&#8221; greeted he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; said Scanlon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Back again, I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;once more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody asked for you to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That so?&#8221; said Scanlon, his glance going to
Ashton-Kirk.</p>

<p>The detective dug carelessly at the hard-packed
earth of the platform with the tip of the hickory
stick.</p>

<p>&#8220;The person who asked for my friend the last
time he stopped off here was a stranger to you, I
understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ancient official took one of the thumbs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
from under a brace and raked it thoughtfully
through the wisp of beard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t remember ever seeing him before,&#8221;
stated he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you couldn&#8217;t recall what he looked
like?&#8221;</p>

<p>The ancient looked injured.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sixty-seven year old,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but I got
good eyesight, and a better memory than most.
That man I talked to that night was a stranger at
the Furnace. If I&#8217;d ever set an eye on him before
I&#8217;d remembered him. He was fat and white and
soft looking. And he talked soft and walked
soft. When he went away, I&#8217;d kind of a feeling
that I&#8217;d been talking to a batter pudding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen him since?&#8221; asked the crime
student.</p>

<p>The old man shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. And I don&#8217;t know how he got here or
went away, unless he drove or come in a motor.
He didn&#8217;t use the trains.&#8221;</p>

<p>The road down toward the river was steep, and
lined with trees upon each side; their interwoven
branches overhead, as Scanlon had explained,
were dense enough to keep out most of the light.
&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty much the same kind of a night as
the one I used when I first came here,&#8221; said Bat.
&#8220;Stars, but no moon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wooden bridge, with a peaked roof over it,
crossed the river at the foot of the road; the
square openings upon either side showed the dark
water flowing sullenly along.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; and Bat Scanlon pointed out at one
of the windows of the bridge. &#8220;There are the
lights of Schwartzberg.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some distance away&mdash;perhaps a mile&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
high above the west bank of the river, hung a
cluster of lights. So lonely were these, and so
pale and cold that they might well have marked
the retreat of some necromancer, in which he
pored over his dark books of magic.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a peculiar thing,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk, his
eyes upon the far-off lights, &#8220;what various forms
fear takes. Here is a man who, apparently, is in
constant terror of some one, or something, and
yet we find him lodged stubbornly in a place
where a secret blow might be levelled at him with
the greatest ease.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That struck me more than once,&#8221; spoke Mr.
Scanlon. &#8220;And I felt like putting it to him as a
question shaped something like: &#8216;Why stay
here when there&#8217;s places where there&#8217;s more
folks? Why stick around a spot where there&#8217;s
always some one cutting in with an unwelcome
surprise, when you can get good house-room in
places where there&#8217;s plenty of burglar alarms?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Their feet sounded drearily upon the loose
planks of the bridge; and when they emerged at
the far end they found themselves upon a narrow
road which ran off into the darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;On, over the hills, in and out, and up and
down, until it lands you at Schwartzberg gate,&#8221;
said Scanlon.</p>

<p>They climbed to the top of a hill; the sky was
thick with stars, and the light from them touched
the high places with pale hands. But the hollows
were black and deep looking; mystery followed
the course of the slowly running river.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is there round about Campe&#8217;s place?&#8221;
asked the crime specialist. &#8220;Is this the only
road that leads there? What are his neighbours
like?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>&#8220;To the first of those questions,&#8221; said Mr.
Scanlon, &#8220;I reply, fields&mdash;also hills&mdash;also woods.
There are roads passing Schwartzberg upon either
side. As to neighbours, there&#8217;s a few farmers,
and their help. And then there&#8217;s the man who
flags the bad crossing down by the river, and
the inn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, you mentioned the inn before,&#8221; said
Ashton-Kirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;A big, old-fashioned place&mdash;built back in the
old days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With a wide hearth and a hearty old landlord,
whose father and grandfather owned the
house before him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s how it ought to be, to be in the
picture; but it happens that this landlord has
been here for only about six months.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scanlon heard the hickory stick slashing at a
clump of dried brush; then the crime specialist
spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;How far away is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A couple of miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;d be as well if we went there and
bespoke a bed, if they&#8217;ll take us in,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk.</p>

<p>Scanlon seemed surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess they&#8217;ve got room,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But I
had it in my mind you were going to Schwartzberg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will pay it a visit, if I&#8217;m permitted, when I&#8217;ve
had a chance to see something of its surroundings.
Your story, you see, shows plainly that, whatever
the nature of Campe&#8217;s danger, it comes from
the outside.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scanlon seemed struck by this; then he nodded
and said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s right. But don&#8217;t you think a
good chance to pump Campe for some inside
information would be better than anything
else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In its proper place, perhaps. But I want to
look over the outside, uninfluenced. Five minutes&#8217;
talk with a man in Campe&#8217;s state of mind
might colour one&#8217;s thoughts to such an extent
that it would be difficult to see anything except
with his eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds sensible enough,&#8221; agreed Bat.
&#8220;And if there&#8217;s anything in the world you don&#8217;t
want to get doing, it&#8217;s seeing things as he sees
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>They followed the narrow road for some distance,
and then the big man turned off into a
path which led through a stretch of farm land.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a short cut,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I followed it
frequently when I was out with the gun. It&#8217;ll
bring us to a road a bit beyond this wood; and
the road leads on to the inn.&#8221;</p>

<p>A hundred yards further on they topped the
crest of a hill; before them loomed a dense growth
of trees which covered the slopes round about.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fine kind of a place in summer, I should
think,&#8221; said Scanlon, as they halted. &#8220;But of
an autumn night when the air gets chill, the stars
look far away, and there&#8217;s a pretty well settled
belief that some queer things are about, it&#8217;s got
its weak side. When I was staying in Canyon, I
swore in as a deputy one night and started out
into the hills with the magistrate to look for two
lads who&#8217;d held up a train and got away with a
bag full of money. That country was much
wilder than this, and was further away from anywhere;
but,&#8221; with a look at the gloomy wooded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
slopes, &#8220;believe me, it couldn&#8217;t compare with this
for that uncertain feeling.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they stood gazing about, Ashton-Kirk&#8217;s
head suddenly went up. He bent forward in the
attitude of listening.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked the big man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark!&#8221;</p>

<p>Far away, among the hills to the north, came a
deep muttering, Scanlon clutched the crime
specialist&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Listen to it lift.
It&#8217;s the thing I heard roaring in the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Low, growling, ominous at first, the sound
grew in volume. Then it pealed like a mighty
voice, rolling and echoing from hill to hill, finally
subsiding and dying in the muttering with which
it began.</p>

<p>&#8220;According to custom,&#8221; remarked Scanlon,
in an uneasy tone, &#8220;Campe is now due to take his
gun in hand and dash for the gate. And, if he
does, they&#8217;ll do more than slash him. I&#8217;ve got
an idea they&#8217;ll get him this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he said the last word, a shaft of brilliant
light shot from the tower of Schwartzberg, and
flashed to and fro across the countryside.</p>

<p>Then came the quick, far-off pulsation of a
rifle; in the widening beam of white light they
saw a woman crouching down as though in fear;
and then they caught the figure of a man, running
as though for his life.</p>

<small>TELLS SOMETHING OF THE MAN IN THE ROLLING
CHAIR</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;CAMPE!&#8221; cried Bat Scanlon, his eyes upon
the fleeing man, and his hand going, with
the instinctive movement of an old gun
man, to his hip. &#8220;And giving his little performance
outside once more.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the keen eyes of the crime specialist had
picked up details which the other had missed.
He shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Campe is a young man, you
say. This is one past middle life. And also he
seems sadly out of condition, and does not run at
all like a man who once took middle distance
honours.&#8221;</p>

<p>The searching column of light still clung to the
running man; again and again came the light
shocks of the distant rifle.</p>

<p>&#8220;The woman has faded out of the lime-light,&#8221;
observed Scanlon.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the man is trying his best to duplicate the
feat. Look&mdash;there he goes!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a wild side leap, the fugitive vanished into
a shallow ravine, out of range of both the ray and
the rifle. At this the searchlight was snapped
off and darkness once more settled over the hills.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your German sergeant-major is a poor shot,&#8221;
commented Ashton-Kirk. &#8220;He had his man in
full view and missed him repeatedly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scanlon shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must have been the light,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Kretz
can shoot. I&#8217;ve seen him at it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>They stood in silence for a few moments; the
country road about seemed heavier with shadows
than it had been before the appearance of the
shifting beam of light; the stars looked fainter.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the second time I&#8217;ve seen that girl out
here in the night,&#8221; continued the big man. &#8220;And
each time the noise came, and things started
doing. I wonder what&#8217;s the idea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancy it&#8217;s a trifle early to venture an opinion
upon anything having to do with this most interesting
affair,&#8221; said his companion. &#8220;But,&#8221;
quietly, &#8220;we may stumble upon an explanation
as we go further into it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; said Scanlon, fervently. Then,
in the tone of a man who had placed himself unreservedly
in the hands of another, &#8220;What next?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;d better go on to the inn.&#8221;</p>

<p>If the other thought the crime specialist&#8217;s wish
would have been to take up their course in the
direction of the recently enacted drama, he said
nothing. He led the way along the narrow path,
and through the gloomy growth of wood. They
emerged after a space into a well-kept road, and
holding to this, approached a rambling, many
gabled old house which twinkled with lighted
windows and gave out an atmosphere of cheer.
A huge porch ran all around it; an immense barn
stood upon one side; and half-a-dozen giant
sycamores towered above all.</p>

<p>&#8220;There it is,&#8221; said Scanlon. &#8220;And it looks as
though it had been there for some time, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A fine, cheery old place,&#8221; commented Ashton-Kirk,
his eyes upon the erratic gables, the twinkling
windows and the welcoming porch. &#8220;Many
a red fire has burned upon its snug hearths of a
winter night; and many a savoury dish has come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
out of its kitchen. Travelling in the old days was
not nearly so comfortable as now; but it had its
recompenses.&#8221;</p>

<p>Their feet crunched upon the gravel walk, and
then sounded hollowly in the empty spaces of the
porch. Scanlon pushed open a heavy door which
admitted them to a great room with a low ceiling,
beamed massively, and coloured as with smoke.
The floor was sanded; a fire of pine logs roared
up a wide-throated chimney; brass lamps, fixed in
sockets in the walls, threw a warm yellowish glow
upon polished pewter tankards and painted china
plates. The tables and chairs were of oak,
scrubbed white by much attentive labour; prim
half curtains graced the small-paned windows.</p>

<p>A short man with a comfortable presence, a
white apron and a red face came forward to greet
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-evening, Mr. Scanlon,&#8221; said he, cordially.
&#8220;I&#8217;m pleased to see you, sir. I&#8217;d been
told you&#8217;d given us up and gone off to the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just for a breather, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; Scanlon informed
him, as he and the crime specialist sat at
a table near to the blazing hearth. It was still
autumn, but there had been a dampness and a
chill in the night air which made the snugness of
the inn very comfortable.</p>

<p>The red-faced landlord smiled genially.</p>

<p>&#8220;I might have known that, even if the shooting
is none too good, the bracing air would bring you
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk glanced about the public room.
A small, cramped-looking man sat at a table with
a draught board before him, studying a complex
move of the pieces through a pair of thick-lensed
glasses. A polished crutch stood at one side of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
his chair, and a heavy walking stick at the other.
Deeply absorbed in the problem and its working
out was another man, younger, but drawn-looking,
who coughed and applied a handkerchief to
his lips with great frequency.</p>

<p>The hearty looking landlord caught the glances
of the crime specialist, and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;My customers are a fragile lot,&#8221; said he in a
low voice. &#8220;The inns get only that kind in the
winter,&#8221; as though in explanation, &#8220;and some of
them are worse than these. It&#8217;s the air that
does it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Makes them ill?&#8221; smiled Ashton-Kirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless you, no!&#8221; The landlord placed a
broad hand to his mouth to restrain the great
responsive laugh which seemed struggling in his
chest. &#8220;The air does &#8217;em good, so the doctors
say. Well, anyway,&#8221; his humorous eyes twinkling,
&#8220;it does <i>me</i> good by getting me over the
slow season. If it wasn&#8217;t for them, I&#8217;d have to
close up after September&#8217;s done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scanlon ordered some cigars and coffee, and as
the host moved away to procure these, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The doctors are a great lot, eh? Once they
piled all the high-coloured drugs into you that
you&#8217;d hold; and now they talk fresh air until
you&#8217;d almost believe you could live on that alone.
There&#8217;s one old codger who&#8217;s got a pet patient
here&mdash;some sort of a rare and costly complaint, I
believe&mdash;and he insists on fresh air at all stages
of the game. The patient, it seems, likes an
occasional change; but the doc. is as deaf as a post
to everything except the sighing of the wind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Coffee and cigars were served.</p>

<p>&#8220;Both black and strong,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk, as
he tested one after the other.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>&#8220;The coffee, sir, as Mr. Scanlon knows, is made
after my own recipe,&#8221; stated the landlord. &#8220;I&#8217;d
not recommend it to one of my invalid guests,
sir, nor to a well one as a regular tipple. But it
has the quality and the touch, if you know what
I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;White is to move and win,&#8221; stated the
cramped-looking man. He rubbed one side of
his nose with a hand that shook, and there was
complaint in the gaze with which he fixed the
pieces. &#8220;But I can&#8217;t see how it&#8217;s going to
do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;White is to move, and win in four other
moves,&#8221; said the drawn-looking man, coughing
into the handkerchief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which makes it all the more difficult,&#8221; said
the other. His palsied hand fumbled purposelessly
with the pieces; and the look of complaint
deepened. The man with the handkerchief
coughed once more, and looked mildly triumphant.</p>

<p>&#8220;They seem to be constantly engaged in these
mad diversions,&#8221; said Scanlon, his eyes upon the
two. &#8220;At times, when I&#8217;ve been here, I&#8217;ve seen
the excitement rise to that degree that I&#8217;ve considered
calling out the fire department.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then there came a strident voice from
another apartment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who the devil is it?&#8221; it demanded. &#8220;If
matters of importance are to be interfered with in
this way, it&#8217;s time that something was done&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the man with the cough reached out and
clapped to a door, shutting out the voice. The
landlord looked discomfited.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, Mr. Shaw,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I
know it&#8217;s annoying to you; but Mr. Alva must
be worse to-day, and so is very impatient.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>The drawn-looking man coughed hollowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry for the gentleman&#8217;s condition,&#8221;
spoke he, huskily. &#8220;But he should remember
that there are others here who are equally ill in
their own way; and that his outbursts are not at
all agreeable.&#8221;</p>

<p>The strident voice was lifted once more, this
time muffled by the door; then another voice
was heard remonstrating and apparently advising.
Then there followed a soft rolling sound, the door
opened once more and an invalid&#8217;s chair made
its appearance, propelled by a squat, dark servant,
whose flat nose and coarse straight hair
gave him the look of an Indian.</p>

<p>Beside the chair hopped a peppery little man
with white hair and eye-glasses from which hung
a wide black string.</p>

<p>&#8220;It makes no difference who he is,&#8221; declared
the peppery little man, fixing the glasses more
firmly upon his nose and speaking to the occupant
of the chair. &#8220;The facts remain as I have
said. But, Mr. Alva, there seems to be very
little use in advising you. In spite of all I can
say you&#8217;ll keep indoors. Suppose it is dark?
The darkness can&#8217;t hurt you. Suppose it is
damp? You can protect yourself against
that. Air is what you want&mdash;fresh air&mdash;billions
of gallons of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man in the chair was wasted and pale; his
almost fleshless hands lay upon the chair arms;
his limbs seemed shrunken to the bone.</p>

<p>Bat Scanlon looked at Ashton-Kirk and nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever it is that&#8217;s got <i>him</i> has got him for
good,&#8221; spoke he, in a low tone. &#8220;I never saw
any man&#8217;s body so close to death without being
dead.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>The eyes of Ashton-Kirk were fixed upon the
sick man with singular interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; said he, in the same low-pitched
way, &#8220;his head is very much alive. It probably
would not be too much to say that it is the most
vital thing in the room.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scanlon looked at the invalid with fresh interest.
He saw a dark face, not at all that of a sick man,
and a pair of burning, searching black eyes.
There seemed to be something unusual about the
upper part of the head, but the man was so
muffled up, apparently about to be taken out,
that the nature of this was not quite clear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drugs,&#8221; stated the peppery little man, &#8220;are
useless; time has no effect. To reach a case of
your kind, air must be supplied&mdash;clear air&mdash;air
containing all the elements of life. If I am to
make a well man of you where others have failed,
you must do as I say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the fresh-air crank I was telling you
about a while ago,&#8221; Scanlon informed the crime
specialist, softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I must go out,&#8221; spoke the invalid in a surprisingly
strong voice, &#8220;wrap me up well. I feel
the cold easily.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little doctor began arranging the blankets
about the shrunken limbs; and while he was
doing so, Ashton-Kirk arose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me assist you,&#8221; said he, with that calm
assurance which is seldom denied.</p>

<p>Deftly he tucked in the coverlets upon the
opposite side, and buttoned up the heavy coat.
But when he reached for the muffling folds about
the sick man&#8217;s head, all the sureness seemed to
leave his fingers; Scanlon was astonished to see
him bungle the matter most disgracefully;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
instead of accomplishing what he set out to do, he
succeeded in knocking the covering off altogether.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; he said, smoothly enough.</p>

<p>The invalid returned some commonplace answer;
and the doctor set about repairing the
result of the volunteer&#8217;s awkwardness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your intentions are the best in the world,&#8221;
smiled he, &#8220;but I can see that you have spent
very little of your time about sick beds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he opened the door, and beckoned the
Indian. The chair rolled out upon the porch, and
a moment later could be heard crunching along
the gravel walk.</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk smoked his black cigar with much
silent deliberation, and sipped at the strong coffee.
Several times during the next half hour Scanlon
attempted to bring him out of this state by remarks
as to the inn and its population. But he
received replies of the most discouraging nature,
and so gave it up. When the cigar was done,
the crime specialist arose and stretched his arms
wide in a yawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;m for bed,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Scanlon looked his astonishment, but said nothing.
His imagination had pictured some hours
of looking about among the darkened hills&mdash;just
how and what for he had little idea; and this
announcement suddenly bringing the night to a
close was not in the least what he had expected.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; was his reply. &#8220;That&#8217;ll do for
me, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rooms were assigned them, and each was provided
with a candle in a copper candlestick; and
so they went off up the wide staircase. From the
adjoining room, Bat Scanlon heard the sound
of pacing feet for some time; after a little they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
stopped, but for all that he had no assurance
that the special detective had gone to bed. So
he stepped out and knocked at his door.</p>

<p>Entering, he found Ashton-Kirk, his hands deep
in his trousers pockets, standing staring at the
grotesque flare of the candle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; said the big man, &#8220;I thought you were
regularly sleepy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am&mdash;a little. But an idea occurred to me
downstairs, and I&#8217;ve been trying to follow it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more he resumed his pacing, his hands
behind him, his eyes upon the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Imagination is, perhaps, man&#8217;s greatest gift,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Without it there would be little accomplished
in the world. But there are times when
one is forced to put the brakes upon it, or it would
lead one astray.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scanlon looked at him curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s set you off on that?&#8221; asked he.</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk stopped in his pacing, and lifted
his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;That object he had given you on the bridge
upon the occasion of your first visit, and which
afterward had such a startling effect upon young
Campe&mdash;what did you say it was like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a stone&mdash;not very big&mdash;dark green in
colour&mdash;and with a kind of hump upon one side
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The crime student nodded; there was a look
in the singular eyes which Bat Scanlon had seen
there only upon rare occasions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I remembered it as being something like that,&#8221;
said Ashton-Kirk. He took up the interrupted
pacing for a moment; then paused once more.
&#8220;What do you make of that sound we heard out
on the hills to-night?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>Scanlon shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got me,&#8221; said he. &#8220;That&#8217;s one of the
things I put up to you when I called you in as a
consultant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk stood looking at him, nodding his
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, to be sure. Well, we&#8217;ll see what can
be done. And now,&#8221; with a look at his watch,
&#8220;if you don&#8217;t mind being turned out, I think I&#8217;ll
go to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean to have a try at the Schwartzberg
folks in the morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scanlon turned and had his hand upon the door-knob
when the crime specialist spoke again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather a peculiarly shaped head that man in
the chair has.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I noticed it,&#8221; replied Scanlon. &#8220;It seems to
slant back from just above the nose. Gives him
an unusual look.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unusual&mdash;yes. I don&#8217;t think I ever saw that
exact conformation except in&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; here he stopped
short. &#8220;Well,&#8221; with another nod, &#8220;good-night.
See you in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<small>SPEAKS OF ASHTON-KIRK&#8217;S FIRST VISIT
TO SCHWARTZBERG</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the following morning, Ashton-Kirk and
Scanlon breakfasted at the inn; then
they each smoked another of the black
cigars. At about nine o&#8217;clock they paid their bill
and left.</p>

<p>&#8220;This road,&#8221; said Bat Scanlon, as they trudged
along, &#8220;is rather direct; it leads on to an old mill
built years ago, and now abandoned, and then
down to the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All things considered,&#8221; spoke Ashton-Kirk,
twirling his hickory stick, his keen eyes searching
the ground, &#8220;we&#8217;d better get away from the roads
and paths this morning, and head for Campe&#8217;s
place, across country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without any comment, Scanlon followed his
lead. Down one slope and up another they went,
skirting ravines and gullys, but always keeping
the towers of Schwartzberg in sight. The crime
specialist seemed in excellent humour; he whistled
little airs, and cut at the stubble and withered
stalks with his stick. But always were the keen,
observant eyes travelling here and there; once or
twice he left his companion and darted away; but
he always returned in a very short time, smiling
and shaking his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;An interesting place,&#8221; said he. &#8220;There are
many indications of enterprise and thought. I
shall have to go over it carefully; it promises to
repay even a great deal of labour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look there,&#8221; said Scanlon.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>Ashton-Kirk&#8217;s eyes followed the pointing finger.
Upon the wall of Schwartzberg even at that distance
could be seen a human figure.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Campe,&#8221; said Scanlon. &#8220;He&#8217;s just
noticed us.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, the man on the wall drew out a
field-glass and trained it upon them. Long and
earnestly he looked; then without making a sign,
he lowered the glass, turned and disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone to tell Kretz that I&#8217;ve hove in sight and
am bringing a stranger,&#8221; said Scanlon.</p>

<p>As they approached the building its details became
more distinct. The grey stone, the narrow
windows, the massive wall, the towers, indeed, all
about the edifice, called up memories of those old
feudal keeps in the Rhine country.</p>

<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me in the least to see the
gates swing wide, and the Baron and his men,
with bows and bills, ride forth to bid us stand,&#8221;
said Ashton-Kirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there goes the gate,&#8221; said Scanlon,
shading his eyes from the sun. &#8220;And here come
Campe and the sergeant-major. I don&#8217;t see any
bows nor bills; but it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if both
packed a perfectly competent &#8216;gat&#8217; somewhere
about his person, ready to bring into action should
you demonstrate anything but friendship and
good will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be careful to put nothing else on display,&#8221;
smiled Ashton-Kirk. &#8220;And now,&#8221; with
seriousness, &#8220;one word before they get too near.
I am simply a friend of yours. You saw me in
the city, and as I professed an interest in Schwartzberg,
you brought me out to put in an hour showing
me over the place if the owner does not consider
it too great a liberty.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>&#8220;I get you,&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon, briefly.</p>

<p>Here the two advancing men came up. Young
Campe was a well-built fellow and of good height.
But his face was pale; there was a wild look in
his eyes, and his manner indicated extreme nervousness.
Scanlon&#8217;s description of the German
sergeant-major was quite accurate; he was square
built and grim-faced; there was a thick greyish
patch in the hair above each ear; and he carried
himself with the stiff precision of a man trained in
a European barrack.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you?&#8221; cried Scanlon, shaking Campe
by the hand. &#8220;Would have got here last night,
but I had a friend with me, and we stopped at the
inn. Mr. Ashton-Kirk,&#8221; nodding toward that
gentleman, by way of introduction.</p>

<p>Campe shook hands with the specialist in crimes,
and Kretz saluted after his military fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Ashton-Kirk listened to me tell about
Schwartzberg until he felt that he couldn&#8217;t live
another day without taking it in,&#8221; Scanlon informed
them. &#8220;So he&#8217;s come over this morning,
hoping it wouldn&#8217;t be asking too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>Campe&#8217;s haunted eyes searched Ashton-Kirk;
it was on his lips to refuse the request, when the
other stopped him by saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll pardon me; but the fact is, I am
something of a student of the period in which
your house was built, and its absolute following,
line for line, of the ancient plan, is of great interest.
The Count Hohenlo, builder of the place, was
related to you, I understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An ancestor of my mother&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed. That&#8217;s very charming. The
Count&#8217;s career in this country was a most romantic
one. The part he played in the history of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
republic in its infancy has been obscured by the
fanfare made in behalf of men not nearly so notable.
His duel with the Frenchman, De La Place, was
an exquisite piece of knight errantry; and his
defence of the ford below here, while the British
occupied the city, was an act of daring which the
historians do not make the most of.&#8221;</p>

<p>A faint flush came into the cheeks of young
Campe.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an unusual thing to come upon one who
knows anything of the Count&#8217;s life or doings,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;I agree with you that the historians
do not make the most of the exploit of the ford,
nor do they give him any of the credit that is his
due in other matters. It is my intention to write
his biography some day; and I hope in that way to
give him, in some small part at least, the place
among the great outlanders which is rightfully
his.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Splendid!&#8221; applauded the crime specialist,
while Bat Scanlon stood by and looked and
listened in amazement. &#8220;That&#8217;s a fine idea.
The romance of two periods, and of three countries
is in your hands. Such things are done too
seldom in this day; in our hurry and bustle we
have no time for the heroes of the past.&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Campe looked at Sergeant-Major Kretz.
But the grim face of the German was turned
away; it was as though he knew what was to be
asked in the look, and so saved himself the mortification
of giving advice which he felt would not
be taken.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am living a more or less retired life just now,
Mr. Ashton-Kirk,&#8221; said Campe, &#8220;and make it a
rule to receive no one. But,&#8221; and here his gaze
went to Scanlon, &#8220;since you are a friend of Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
Scanlon&#8217;s, and are on the ground, it would hardly
do,&#8221; and here he smiled, though faintly, &#8220;to turn
you away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kirk,&#8221; said Scanlon, &#8220;has been my friend for
years. He&#8217;s quite a fellow in his way and has
been of service to many folks, who were ready to
put up their hands and quit. Now, here&#8217;s your
little matter,&#8221; eagerly: &#8220;he could take hold of
that, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But the voice of Ashton-Kirk broke in on him
swiftly, but with a smoothness that covered its
haste.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our friend Scanlon,&#8221; said he, smilingly, &#8220;is
something of an enthusiast. He has too much
confidence in my little array of historical incident.
But,&#8221; and his singular eyes looked steadily into
those of Campe, &#8220;if I can be of any assistance to
you in the memoirs which you mean to prepare,
you may command me. I shall be only too
glad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I thought,&#8221; stated Scanlon,
blowing his nose and growing very red. &#8220;I
know you&#8217;ve got this historical stuff stuffed in
till it&#8217;s over your ears; so what&#8217;s more natural
than that you should give Campe a lift?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be that at some future time, when I am
in the frame of mind for quiet study, I shall avail
myself of your knowledge, sir,&#8221; said Campe, as
they walked toward the castle. &#8220;But at the
present time,&#8221; and once more the smile, though
even fainter than before, showed itself, &#8220;I am
much taken up with more active matters, and
have not the leisure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kretz took a huge key from his pocket and unlocked
the gate; then he stood aside and the
others passed in. The gate was at once relocked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>&#8220;This,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk, as he looked about,
&#8220;would resist a considerable force, even in these
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>The high grey wall towered above their heads;
it was a great thickness and its strength was
evident.</p>

<p>Young Campe looked up at it and shook his
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s strong enough,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But for all
that, Mr. Ashton-Kirk, it cannot keep out
thoughts; and thoughts, if they are strongly
marked and along a definite line, are more to be
feared than armies.&#8221;</p>

<p>They crossed the flagged court of which Scanlon
had spoken and entered by the high, narrow
door. A gloomy passage brought them to a room,
the same, evidently, in which Bat had been received,
for it was furnished with heavy oaken
tables and chairs of ancient design, had a vaulted
ceiling and was ornamented with the heads of
huge stags and boars, and with trophies of arms,
all of a day far past.</p>

<p>A girl stood at one side feeding a thrush through
the bars of a basket cage; she was attired in a
gown flowing and white, her hair was the colour
of yellow silk, parted in the centre, and hanging
down over her breast in two thick braids.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Knowles,&#8221; said Campe, and the girl
turned. &#8220;A friend of Mr. Scanlon,&#8221; continued
the young man, &#8220;Mr. Ashton-Kirk.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl was very beautiful; her skin was like
velvet, and her colour like roses. She was smiling
as the crime specialist bowed to her; but upon the
instant that his name was mentioned, the receptacle
which held the grain she had been offering
the bird fell to the stone floor and smashed; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
delicate colour left her cheeks; she stood staring,
her blue eyes full of consternation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grace!&#8221; cried Campe, in alarm.</p>

<p>But in a single instant she had recovered herself;
the colour rushed back to her face, the smile
returned to the lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is nothing at all,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That headache
of which I complained yesterday seems not
to have all gone. I&#8217;ve felt a little faint several
times this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should not be about,&#8221; said Campe,
anxiously. &#8220;And perhaps it would be best if
a doctor saw you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl smiled sweetly. Her teeth were magnificent;
and her lips were scarlet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some stunner, eh?&#8221; whispered Bat Scanlon
to Ashton-Kirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be about is the best thing I can do,&#8221; said
Miss Knowles. Then with a mischievous look,
&#8220;Mr. Kirk will think I&#8217;m quite an invalid.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was really a splendid creature, large and
beautifully formed; her complexion, her eyes, the
great crown of yellow hair and the flowing white
gown gave her the appearance, backed as she was
by the grey trophy-hung wall, of having stepped
out of a medi&aelig;val picture&mdash;the stately lady of
some great baron, or the daughter of a belted earl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Invalids seem rather plenty hereabouts,&#8221; said
Ashton-Kirk with a quiet smile. &#8220;But none of
them at all resembled you, Miss Knowles.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed, to the eyes of Bat Scanlon, that a
change came into the beautiful face&mdash;a subtle
something, swift as the thought that occasioned it,
and gone as quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been to the inn,&#8221; she said with a gesture
of dismay. &#8220;Poor things; isn&#8217;t it dreadful?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
Some of them are really heart-breaking, they seem
so helpless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve visited the inn yourself, then?&#8221; and
there was a mild note of inquiry in the pleasant
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no; but I ride sometimes among the hills
of a morning. It&#8217;s a glorious place for that; and
I meet them stalking slowly along, or being
wheeled in their chairs. Perhaps it is the contrast
between the vigour of the season and their
wretched state, but at any rate I feel very bad
about it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Kirk is a student of American history,
and is interested in Schwartzberg and the builder,&#8221;
Campe informed the girl. &#8220;I am about to show
him over the place. Will you go along?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, yes.&#8221; Then to Ashton-Kirk, &#8220;I
never get tired of the splendid old building; most
of my time is spent in wandering about from
room to room, imagining the history it does not
possess,&#8221; with a smile which once more showed
her beautiful teeth. &#8220;Oh, if it were only as rich
in romance as it seems to be! If the good Count
Hohenlo had only performed some of his deeds
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who knows,&#8221; smiled Ashton-Kirk, &#8220;but
that it has been left to a later time to give the old
place the needed touch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Miss Knowles, lightly, as she
followed Campe out of the room and along a passage,
&#8220;there are no strange knights to beat upon
the portals with the handles of their swords; there
are no arquebuseers to swarm over the wall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; that&#8217;s gone for good; but,&#8221; and Bat
Scanlon thought he detected an undercurrent of
something in the crime specialist&#8217;s voice, &#8220;as Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
Campe suggested a while ago, high walls cannot
keep out thoughts. Peril in these later days is not
as candid as in feudal times&mdash;it has a mysterious
quality&mdash;we can neither hear nor see it, at times,
but it is there, nevertheless.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl looked at the speaker; and there was
a smile in her blue eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you think a place like Schwartzberg
might get its romance in such a very modern
manner! I&#8217;ll not believe it. Nothing but the
clash of arms will satisfy me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Campe laughed, but there was very
little of mirth in the sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it may come to that in the
end.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Miss Knowles made a pretty gesture of
protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t make game of me, Frederic,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;You mean the tramp scoundrels
who have been giving you so much trouble. They
make very poor substitutes for men in armour,
and I refuse to consider them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Room after room was visited and admired;
each was in keeping, both in furnishing and decoration,
with the period of the building&#8217;s architecture.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is really tremendous,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk,
&#8220;and must require a horde of servants to keep it
in order.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have only two besides Kretz&mdash;and they
are his wife and daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to see the kitchen,&#8221; said the
crime specialist. &#8220;Very different, I suppose,
from our present compact institutions.&#8221;</p>

<p>The kitchen was as huge as imagined; its
bricked floor was scrubbed clean; its copper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
utensils gleamed upon the walls; the great fireplace
held a turnspit upon which hung a goose,
attended by a stolid-looking girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sergeant-major&#8217;s daughter?&#8221; asked
Ashton-Kirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and here is her mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>A heavy, vacant-looking woman entered the
kitchen with some vegetables; she gave but a
passing glance at the visitors, and tucking up
her sleeves, proceeded indifferently about her
duties.</p>

<p>As they reached the roof of Schwartzberg, Ashton-Kirk
saw the searchlight, which he had witnessed
in operation the night before, mounted on
one of the towers. It was a powerful affair, and
seemed in perfect order. But as to its uses
Campe said nothing; he passed it by as though it
did not exist.</p>

<p>Away in every direction stretched the faded
countryside; the hills swelled, the tops of the
denuded trees waved starkly in the breeze.</p>

<p>&#8220;The prospect is sober at this time of the year,&#8221;
said Ashton-Kirk, as he gazed out over the hills.
&#8220;But the summer at Schwartzberg, I should say,
is very beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Campe nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it is. I have not spent such
time here before now; but the pleasant months
would be well enough&mdash;if there were nothing
else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk, &#8220;there are drawbacks,
then. Nothing serious, I hope?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at the young man with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;The plumbing, perhaps,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It seldom
is what it should be in houses like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Campe shook his head, and made no reply.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
His eyes, still with the old haunted look lurking
in them, went out over the country, and one hand
stroked his chin.</p>

<p>There was very little conversation while they
remained upon the roof. Descending, they were
passing along a broad corridor when the sound of
a harp, waveringly played, was heard and a voice
singing a <i>lied</i>.</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk, trailing observantly along in the
rear, saw the girl start at this and pause. A
strange look came into her face; her hand went
to her lips as though to prevent the words she
was already speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; she said, sweetly, &#8220;Mr. Kirk should
not go without a view of the tapestries.&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Campe looked perplexed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said he to Ashton-Kirk, &#8220;there are
some rare hangings&mdash;some six or seven centuries
old, I understand. And they are quite well worth
seeing. But my aunt is there,&#8221; and he gestured
toward a door, &#8220;and I&#8217;m not at all sure that
she&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated; and the girl spoke quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll be pleased to see a visitor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then without waiting for a reply, she knocked
upon the door and went in. In a moment she
held the door wide and smiled out at the three
men.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may come in,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Upon entering the apartment Ashton-Kirk
noted that it was much more elaborately furnished
than the other portions of the castle. Various
periods had been called upon for luxurious fittings;
costly rugs were upon the floor; magnificent
paintings covered the walls; small carvings, very
miracles of workmanship, were many; and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
tapestries, which hung against and covered the
far wall, were gorgeous examples of that ancient
mystery.</p>

<p>&#8220;My aunt, Miss Hohenlo,&#8221; said Campe, &#8220;Mr.
Ashton-Kirk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll pardon the intrusion,&#8221; said the
crime specialist.</p>

<p>Miss Hohenlo smiled graciously. She was a
small woman, and thin, with faded brown hair
and dull grey eyes. She was elaborately dressed
and rather showily; about her neck hung a string
of splendid jewels. Her hands were remarkably
small and white and well kept; she fingered the
strings of a gilt harp, and showed them delicately
and to advantage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; said she, &#8220;it is no intrusion. Any
friends of Frederic are my friends; I try to impress
that upon him. The tapestries are, of
course, wonderful, and that lovers of beauty should
desire to see them is, of course, to be expected.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had a mincing, artificial manner of speech,
much after the way of a lady in a mid-Victorian
novel; not once did she forget her hands; carefully
she touched the strings of the harp; with
many little turns and flourishes she showed their
whiteness, their smallness, their delicacy.</p>

<p>She spoke of the tapestry and not of her hands,
but it was plain to be seen which of the two she
thought the more worthy of attention; so Ashton-Kirk
conversed with her and admired the caresses
she bestowed upon the strings.</p>

<p>&#8220;The harp,&#8221; said Miss Hohenlo, &#8220;is a beautiful
instrument; in fact, I will say it is the most graceful
of instruments. The Romans and the Greeks,
also, preferred it to the lyre and other forms of
string arrangement.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>&#8220;It is perhaps the most ancient of instruments,&#8221;
said Ashton-Kirk. &#8220;We trace it back to
the Egyptians, and have no assurance that it was
not known even before the time of that astonishing
people. That the tight-drawn string of some
warrior&#8217;s bow first suggested the musical possibility
of the form is more than likely true. Can
you not imagine the earliest minstrel chanting his
song of victory to the twanging of the bowstring
which helped to bring that victory about?&#8221;</p>

<p>Never once since they entered the room had
the golden-haired Miss Knowles taken her eyes
from the face of the woman with the harp; and
she wore a curiously expectant expression which
Ashton-Kirk did not fail to note.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Hohenlo is devoted to her instrument,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;And such attachment is always
charming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Hohenlo simpered, colourlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;To me it is but a toy,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Miss Knowles laughed. It was a light laugh
and had a musical sound; but there was something
behind it which caused the crime specialist&#8217;s
eyes to narrow and grow eager.</p>

<p>&#8220;A toy,&#8221; said Miss Knowles. &#8220;Oh, surely you
don&#8217;t mean that&mdash;after the nights you&#8217;ve shut
yourself up with it in your hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dull eyes of Miss Hohenlo, so it seemed,
grew duller than ever; she looked into the beautiful
face before her, and lifted one slim hand to her
faded hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Grace,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you are such an
observant creature.&#8221; The eyes turned upon Ashton-Kirk,
and she went on: &#8220;And I had hoped
that my poor studies were unnoticed. One can
never be sure of anything.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>Here young Campe, who had been impatiently
intent upon the tapestries, now turned to Ashton-Kirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;These are, perhaps, as early examples of
Flemish weaving as one would be likely to find.
They came into the possession of my family
about the time of the French Revolution, a period
when much that was rare and costly was kicking
about, helter-skelter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk examined the hangings with
admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;From the design,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I&#8217;d venture that
they came from the looms of either Bruges or
Arras. The hand of Van Eyck&mdash;or a follower of
Van Eyck, is unmistakable; and the greater part
of their designs went to the weavers of those two
cities.&#8221;</p>

<p>Between two windows was a narrow strip of the
tapestry, and in examining this the attention of
Ashton-Kirk was drawn to a huge, two-handed
sword which hung against it.</p>

<p>&#8220;A rather competent looking weapon,&#8221; said
he; &#8220;and one which, no doubt, has seen excellent
service.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Knowles came nearer.</p>

<p>&#8220;And who can be sure that its days of service
are over?&#8221; said she, with a smile.</p>

<p>A few moments before the crime specialist had
caught something behind her laugh; now he
fancied a still more subtle something was hidden
behind the smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;This blade was carried in the army of Barbarossa,
at the siege of Milan,&#8221; said young Campe.</p>

<p>&#8220;And by one of Miss Hohenlo&#8217;s remote ancestors,&#8221;
added Miss Knowles, and again came
the enigmatic smile. &#8220;You should hear her tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
the story. It&#8217;s really delightful. Sometimes I
think she cares more for the sword than she does
for the harp.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Hohenlo advanced gingerly; there was
something so mincing in her manner, so entirely
like the old maid of tradition, that Mr. Scanlon
winked very rapidly and watched her with something
like fascination. She stroked the bare blade
with one small hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s ugly,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It is rough and uncouth,
much like a great mastiff reared outdoors
and having no place in the house. But it has done
much for the Hohenlos; it has gained them fortunes
in the past; so why should I not cherish
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not, indeed?&#8221; said Miss Knowles.</p>

<p>Scanlon noted that this apartment seemed of
great interest to Ashton-Kirk; the tapestries were
exclaimed over and talked about; the paintings
were reviewed; the carvings were gone over
minutely; the curious qualities and periods of
various pieces of furniture were discussed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the harp,&#8221; mused the watchful Bat.
&#8220;The harp seems to be the extra added attraction.
It&#8217;s got something that puzzles him, and he keeps
going back to it again and again.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was not only the harp. The great naked
sword hanging between the windows, backed by
the bit of ancient tapestry, also seemed of continued
interest. With a casual air, Ashton-Kirk
more than once examined it; and his eyes, as
Scanlon alone saw, were darting interest for all
his seeming nonchalance. Once he took the
weapon down and tested its weight in a sweeping
stroke.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would take a person of some strength to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
use this with any effect,&#8221; said he, and his eyes
were upon Miss Knowles.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; said she, &#8220;that you are not one of
those who believe that all the power has gone out
of the race&mdash;that those of old times could do more
than those of to-day.&#8221; She took the great
weapon in her hands and raised it aloft with ease.
&#8220;See, even a woman could use it,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>And then with a smile she lowered the weapon
and Campe replaced it upon the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think,&#8221; said the young man, &#8220;there&#8217;s
anything else of interest.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Miss Knowles held up a protesting finger.</p>

<p>&#8220;The vaults!&#8221; she said. &#8220;No one could say
he had seen a castle without visiting those parts
of it that are underground.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Campe did not at all take to the suggestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are damp and gloomy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We
seldom go into them.&#8221; He turned to Ashton-Kirk.
&#8220;However, if you care to see them, I&#8217;ll be
only too glad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it is no trouble,&#8221; said the crime specialist,
his singular eyes upon the beautiful face of Miss
Knowles, &#8220;I&#8217;d be pleased to explore them.&#8221;</p>

<p>With Kretz carrying a lamp, the three men
descended into the regions beneath Schwartzberg.
The damp from the near-by river had stained the
walls and the stones of the pavement, the heavy
arches hung with growths of fungus. The place
was vast and gloomy; the radius of the lamp was
small and beyond it the shadows thickened away
into absolute blackness. The whole progress
through the place seemed a bore to Scanlon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cellars,&#8221; commented he, &#8220;are fine places to
keep coal in. Men who believe in encouraging
industry have also been known to store wine in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
their cellars, so that the spiders could have something
to spin their nets around. But for the purposes
of exercise or for mild morning strolls they
have their drawbacks. As for myself, I should
prefer&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a smash of glass, the lamp
fell into fragments and the place was plunged into
darkness. Scanlon, who was next to Ashton-Kirk,
felt him spring forward like a tiger; then
came a sharp pistol shot, followed by another and
still another.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>IN WHICH ASHTON-KIRK INDICATES MUCH BUT
SAYS LITTLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;A LIGHT!&#8221; cried Campe. &#8220;Strike a
light, Kretz.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No light,&#8221; said Bat Scanlon, softly.
&#8220;It is no time for such things when an unknown
gentleman is about with a gun! And keep still.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant-major grunted something in German,
apparently in approval of this advice. At
any rate, Campe subsided. There was a space of
silence. Then a footstep sounded; and Bat arose.</p>

<p>&#8220;That you, Kirk?&#8221; asked he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; came the quiet voice of the crime specialist.
&#8220;I think it&#8217;s all right now. Is there any
way of getting a light?&#8221;</p>

<p>A match crackled, then Kretz produced a candle
stump from a niche in the wall. This he ignited.
Ashton-Kirk came into the dim circle of radiance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not ask whether you saw anybody,&#8221; said
Scanlon. &#8220;But,&#8221; anxiously, &#8220;did you feel anything
of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather wild firing in the dark,&#8221; returned
the crime specialist. &#8220;And, perhaps,&#8221; here there
was a dryness in his tone, &#8220;that&#8217;s what kept us
from being more or less shot up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go over the place,&#8221; suggested Scanlon.
&#8220;Whoever it was must be still here. Get some
more light, sergeant.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few minutes Kretz had a brace of stable
lanterns; and with these throwing their rays
about, and revolvers held ready, the four men
made their way slowly through the cellars. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
was no rubbish, nor lumber; everything was open
to the lamp-light. And no one was to be found.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said Scanlon, amazed at this.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s a state of affairs. A while ago I wondered
how they got in; now I wonder how they
got out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk had gone over the place keenly;
nothing, even the smallest, seemed to escape him.
Two small openings, heavily barred, allowed the
daylight to drift in, and with his eyes on these, he
asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are these the only means of ventilation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Kretz.</p>

<p>The crime specialist tested the bars; as he
wiped his fingers upon a handkerchief, he asked:
&#8220;How many ways are there of entering the
vaults&mdash;from inside?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One,&#8221; replied Kretz. &#8220;The way we came
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This sort of thing happened once before,&#8221; said
young Campe. His manner was quiet, but his
voice was cold with dread. &#8220;The only difference
was that it was in the night, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The grim-faced Kretz, looking more granite-faced
than ever in the flickering light of the lanterns,
growled something in a low tone; and the
young man stopped instantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the tramps,&#8221; he added hastily. &#8220;We are
greatly troubled by them. Scanlon,&#8221; with a
glance at the big man, &#8220;has seen something of
their work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Taking one of the lights, Ashton-Kirk went over
the place once more. This time he gave much
attention to the floor, and showed considerable
curiosity as to the walls.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said he, laughingly, but not once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
relaxing his attention, &#8220;it is possible that the
Count in his building of this place might have
contrived the secret passage which legend tells us
went with such buildings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Kretz. &#8220;There is a plan of the
house. All is marked there. Nothing is secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>Much to Scanlon&#8217;s surprise, the crime specialist
seemed to take this as final.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a thing which should be brought to the
attention of the police,&#8221; suggested Ashton-Kirk.
&#8220;Prowlers who have secret means of entering
cellars can&#8217;t be comfortable neighbours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might come to that in the end,&#8221; said Campe
as they climbed the stone steps. He had a smile
upon his lips, a wan hopeless sort of thing, and in
the lantern light his eyes looked sunken. &#8220;But
the police are sometimes very troublesome themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>They reached the upper hall, and Ashton-Kirk
looked at his watch and a time-table.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have thirty minutes to reach the station,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had hoped,&#8221; said Campe, &#8220;to have you for
luncheon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some other time I shall be delighted. But
to-day there are some small matters which must
have my attention. Good-bye, and thank
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kretz swung open the outer door; they crossed
the courtyard, and he shot back the great bolts
of the gate. The detective shook hands with
Campe; to Scanlon he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;If it is at all possible, call upon me at ten
o&#8217;clock to-morrow. I think I shall then have
something to tell you in regard to the affair you
spoke to me of yesterday.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be on hand,&#8221; said Bat, with a nod of
assurance. &#8220;Count on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>From a window the beautiful, smiling face of
Miss Knowles looked down upon them. Ashton-Kirk
took off his cap, and with a nod and a little
flourish he was off down the road, swinging with a
long stride, and twirling his hickory stick gaily.</p>

<p>Next day the bell in the tower of the church
next door was striking ten when the punctual Bat
Scanlon presented himself at the crime specialist&#8217;s
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; said that gentleman. &#8220;You are as
sharp as time itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>As usual, he had a pile of books about him;
and the meerschaum pipe was sending its pale
vapours into the room. But these were a different
kind of books. Those which had been heaped
about on the occasion of Mr. Scanlon&#8217;s last visit
were things of dreams and fanciful speculation;
but these, this morning, were keen and practical
looking. The sheep binding seemed to warn off
triflers; the type seemed sharply cut and decisive.
And the very pipe itself seemed to wear a purposeful
air; instead of the leisurely drawing at it that
had marked the other visit, the puffs were now
curt and contained a promise of other things.</p>

<p>Bat Scanlon seated himself in the chair he had
occupied before; and while he lighted the cigar
which was presented to him, his eyes went to the
print of the brown sailors peering away into the
heart of the sea&#8217;s mystery. And now, somehow,
their attitude was changed. The mystery ahead
was as complete as before; indeed, it was, perhaps,
more so; but the brown men now seemed
at ease; to-day they did not fear the unknown;
and, as he looked closely, it even seemed that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
were pleased with the unusualness of their
situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the way I feel,&#8221; Bat told himself.
&#8220;Kirk&#8217;s on the job and he&#8217;ll fix it up as it should
be. So why worry?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk opened a drawer and took out a
folded paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you called me on the telephone the
other day,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I at once set about looking
up the Campe family history. My records had
the facts up to a few years ago. But I wanted
complete information, so I sent one of my men
out to look them up. This is his report, brought
in to me this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>He seated himself upon a corner of the table and
unfolded the paper. Then he read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">&#8220;<i>Report of Later Proceedings of the Campes.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;The family of Campe, as shown by such
information as it is possible to secure from
banks doing business with them, contracting
firms who undertook their various enterprises
and importing houses who have come into
financial contact with them, have been very
clever and able. They slipped naturally from
the wreckage of one government into the favour
of the next without loss of any sort. Their
interests grew; and they seemed in a fair way
to become to Central America what the Rothschilds
are to Europe, when suddenly about
three years ago, things took a change. Frederic
Campe, Sr., head of the house, at about that
time, met his death while on board his yacht
<i>Conquistador</i>, at Vera Cruz. Something went
wrong&mdash;just what it was will never be known,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
for no one on board escaped&mdash;and the vessel was
blown to atoms. Less than six months later,
William Campe, brother to the one lately dead,
also met a sudden and violent end. He was attending
the ceremonies held at the opening of a
great concrete bridge which the family had provided
the money to build, when he in some unaccountable
manner fell from it and was killed.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; ejaculated Scanlon, and knocked
the ash from his cigar.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Henry, eldest son of Frederic, was the next
to go,&#8221; read the crime specialist. &#8220;One morning,
not a great while after the affair at the
bridge, he was found stabbed to death in his
own hall-way. The nature of the wound which
let out his life showed that the attack was a
particularly vicious one. Some very keen and
very heavy weapon must have been used, as the
young man was cut open from his chest to his
waist line.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Bat Scanlon sat suddenly erect in his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said he, in surprise. &#8220;Hello!
What&#8217;s this!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The nature of the wound has a rather familiar
sound, I think,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;A slash down the front with some very heavy
and very sharp weapon,&#8221; said the big man, slowly.
&#8220;That&#8217;s what young Campe got a few nights ago.
Not deep,&#8221; and Bat shook his head, &#8220;but it was
just such a slash as put this other one out of the
running.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk resumed his reading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;At the death of Henry, Mexico had run out
of male Campes. There only remained a
younger son who was then attending a university
in the United States. There were several
daughters, but these have resided for some years
in Berlin. The greater part of the family interests
in Mexico and Central America have been
disposed of, and what&#8217;s left is being offered for
sale. From this, it seems that what remains of
the family have no intention of returning south
of the Rio Grande.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Here the crime specialist folded up the paper,
and threw it upon the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221; asked the big man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; declared Bat, &#8220;to my way of looking
at it, it&#8217;s plenty. In view of the way that man
met his death in the hall-way, can you figure the
matters of the yacht and the bridge as accidents?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;At this distance we can&#8217;t say,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But
the deaths of the three have a stamp upon them
which suggest&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were murdered,&#8221; said Bat. And then,
with his eyes upon the other, he added: &#8220;But
why?&#8221;</p>

<p>The crime specialist slipped from the table.
With the big pipe laid aside, he began to pace up
and down the study.</p>

<p>&#8220;This matter has some very curious and interesting
aspects,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It is more than
likely as you suggest, that the three Campes of
whom you have just heard met their deaths at the
hands of assassins. But, as you also suggest,
why?&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw up the curtains and allowed the sun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
to fill the room; the opening of the windows
themselves permitted the air to rush in and
pursue the smoke clouds furiously about the
place. The drone of the crowds in the street, the
roll of wheels, the cries of drivers to their horses
and to each other lifted to them in a confused
movement of sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Murder,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk, &#8220;is seldom
undertaken without cause.&#8221; He resumed his
pacing, his hands deep in his trousers pockets.
&#8220;Even the lowest type of thug, waylaying his
victim in a lonely place, has the desire for money
as his motive. The drunken loafer of the slums
beats his wife to death because she refuses him
food which he has not earned, or the price of more
liquor which dulls his mind to the barest requirements
of life. The masked burglar does not take
life wantonly, but only when hard pressed and
with the jail staring him in the face. The
poisoner is actuated by jealousy, or by the desire
to remove some one who bars his way to happiness
or wealth. If the Campes were murdered,
there was a reason for it. And the fact that
three of them have so died, and a systematic
effort seems to be proceeding to bring about the
death of a fourth, shows that the reason is not
an individual one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; agreed Bat Scanlon. &#8220;It&#8217;s a family
matter. It&#8217;s something that has to do with
them as a bunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The attention of the murderer,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk,
&#8220;was apparently first fixed upon the head
of the house, the elder Frederic. He was blown
up with his yacht. His brother William was the
succeeding head. He died in a fall from a bridge.
Next, the eldest son of Frederic came into control<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
of the family finances. He was stabbed to death.
The last of them all, and the present head of the
house, is your friend at Schwartzberg. Beyond
a doubt the eyes of the monster are now fixed
upon him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is possible,&#8221; said the crime specialist, &#8220;that
some sort of demand was made upon the elder
Frederic. This was refused and murder followed.
Again the demand was made&mdash;again upon the
head of the house&mdash;and again was refused. Once
more death made its grisly appearance. For
the third time the request was repeated to the
person in control of the family&#8217;s affairs; for the
third time it was denied; and again death followed
swiftly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A request,&#8221; said Bat Scanlon. &#8220;For
what?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And I merely
mention this as a thing which might be true,
understand me. I do not know that it is. But,
supposing it is, perhaps your question can be
answered. The business of the Campes, as a
family, was money. And as the family seems to
have been struck at, and not any individual, is it
carrying the thing too far to think that money
may form the basis of the request?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to me,&#8221; replied Mr. Scanlon, promptly.
&#8220;In fact, it seems very likely, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk continued his pacing up and down.
For the most part he was silent and intent,
apparently thinking hard. Now and then, however,
his thoughts took form in muttered words,
altogether unintelligible to Scanlon, although that
gentleman listened eagerly. After a time the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
crime specialist pressed one of the series of bell
calls, and Fuller made his appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Begin at once,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk, &#8220;and put
Burgess and O&#8217;Neil on the job if you need help.
Get together any facts as to the dealings of the
house of Campe during the time Frederic Campe&mdash;the
one who your report says died aboard his
yacht&mdash;was at the head of the concern. Go into
this to the limit&mdash;don&#8217;t spare trouble, as it is
important. Also try and get some data as to this
same Frederic Campe personally. Who were his
friends? what were his habits?&mdash;what interests,
financial or otherwise, did he oppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks like a large order,&#8221; said Fuller. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
have to get on the ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take the next train south,&#8221; directed the crime
specialist. &#8220;As soon as you get anything, wire
it in our private code.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; said the assistant. &#8220;Anything
more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fuller left the room with hasty step; and Bat
Scanlon nodded his admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;You go after things with both hands in this
shop,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And, as I&#8217;ve always claimed,
that&#8217;s the only way to get them done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our little run out of town,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk,
&#8220;brought several things to my notice which
singly would, perhaps, have suggested nothing;
but collectively they indicated a possible condition,
both picturesque and dangerous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We ran into a small herd of things,&#8221; said Mr.
Scanlon. &#8220;Just which of them do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ashton-Kirk shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;The indications may prove erroneous,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;The hour we spent among the hills around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
Schwartzberg was of the sort in which the imagination
operates vividly; and in such work as we
are now on, care must be taken as to what is fact
and what fancy. Under such influences as were
then abroad, the mind strings thoughts much as a
child strings beads.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused in his pacing and stood by the
window, looking down into the shabby street.
There was a tight look about the corners of his
mouth; the eyes glittered a bit feverishly.</p>

<p>Up and down swarmed the alien horde in the
street. The children seemed countless; the
sounds and smells were thick, and of the near
East.</p>

<p>The stands at the curbs, and at the walls of
buildings were piled with wares of strange make,
and with food that was questionable. Merchants
in long coats, and with the inevitable cigarette
between their fingers, pleaded eloquently with
hedging customers.</p>

<p>Women in bright shawls, which were pulled up
about their heads and faces, huddled upon steps
and peered out at the turmoil about them; the
dull red walls of the buildings and their dirty
windows were unpleasantly prominent in the
morning sun.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ashton-Kirk turned upon Scanlon.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of the Campe household?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;Take them one at a time,
beginning with the lowest in importance&mdash;how do
they stand in the light of your two weeks&#8217;
acquaintance with them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The lowest in importance,&#8221; said the big man,
&#8220;would be Kretz&#8217;s daughter. She&#8217;s got a head
that was made to forget with, and about as much
character as a kitten. I&#8217;ve seen things duller than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
she is, but they were not human things. As for
her mother, I&#8217;ve heard her speak twice&mdash;possibly
three times. Each observation was pointed at
her daughter, was in German, and was, from the
general sound, meant to tell her exactly where
she was wrong. But, though she might be
economical as a conversationalist, she does not
stint her talent as a cook. For she can and does
cook with an abandon and fancy that would take
the creases out of the most crumpled appetite.
Mrs. Kretz is the sort of a woman who would
greet a broken dish and the falling in of the roof
with about the same display of emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kretz himself is almost as eloquent as his
wife. But though he talks little, he sees everything.
Campe tells me he&#8217;s been in the family
for ten years or more, and he has a lot of confidence
in him. As far as I can see&mdash;Kretz&mdash;I
don&#8217;t know. There are some things about him
and his doings that I don&#8217;t understand; but then
I can say the same for most of the folks at the
castle, if it comes to that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the next?&#8221; asked Ashton-Kirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose it&#8217;s a matter of taste just who
is next,&#8221; proceeded Scanlon. &#8220;But to save any
lengthy argument, suppose we say it&#8217;s Campe&#8217;s
aunt, Miss Hohenlo. I don&#8217;t see much of either
of the ladies of the castle, but Miss Hohenlo is the
closest in that respect. As her name shows, Miss
Hohenlo is a maiden; and after one look at her
face and another at her figure I don&#8217;t wonder at
it. Nature seems to have jumped in between her
and any chance she ever had of changing her
condition; for she&#8217;s got the finest little lot of
spinster manners and ideas I ever saw in one
collection. In character she&#8217;s about as colourless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
as water; and she counts about as much as a
grain of rice powder on a chorus girl&#8217;s nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the other lady is different; you&#8217;ve seen
her, and so I&#8217;ll say nothing about her looks
except what I said once before, and that is, she&#8217;s
a pippin! However,&#8221; and the big man bent his
brows at the crime specialist, &#8220;she has a way
with her. As a matter of fact, she has several
ways, and I don&#8217;t understand any of them. Why
did she drop the dish when she first heard your
name? and look as if she&#8217;d got the shock of her
life? What&#8217;s the idea of her wandering out
among the hills at night? The searchlight
caught her standing over Campe&#8217;s senseless body
the night he was cut. And only the other night
you and I saw the light pick her up once more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not give much attention to the woman
on that occasion,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk. &#8220;And so
you think it was Miss Grace Knowles, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who else could it have been?&#8221; demanded
Bat. &#8220;And who else screamed on the night
Kretz met me on the stairs? And that&#8217;s not
all.&#8221; Here the speaker leaned toward the special
detective, and his voice sank lower, as though he
feared to be overheard. &#8220;Last night I got a
fresh slant at her. Eh? With a candle, and
hesitating along the hall-way. When she got to
the door of the room where you saw Miss Hohenlo,
she stopped and listened at the edges of it, as
if she was making sure that no one was there.
I guess there wasn&#8217;t, for she opened the door
and went in.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was at the end of the hall when I saw this
and I waited; for somehow the thing didn&#8217;t look
good. Then I heard footsteps coming along the
lower corridor and some one started up the lower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
flight of steps. Like a flash the door of the room
into which Miss Knowles had gone opened; I
didn&#8217;t see it&mdash;I heard it; for the young lady had
blown out her candle. It was Campe coming up,
and he had a light. She was standing by the
door with as sweet a smile on her face as you
ever saw anywhere, and she gave him a lot of
little nods. He was surprised to see her, but she
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;ve just come to see if your aunt is awake.
I did <i>so</i> want some one to talk to.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so,&#8221; said Bat, &#8220;she knocked on the
door, very gently, just as if she wasn&#8217;t already
sure that no one was there. And she seemed
greatly disappointed when no one answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Talk to me,&#8217; says Campe. You see he fell
for the bunk just as easy as that. &#8216;Talk to me,&#8217;
says he. For when a man&#8217;s in love with a
woman,&#8221; continued Mr. Scanlon, sagely, &#8220;she
can put anything across on him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so you think Campe is in love with Miss
Knowles?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Up to his eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The big man laid the end of his cigar in an ash
tray, and put a hand upon each knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether you noticed it,&#8221;
resumed he, &#8220;but this same Miss Knowles was
peddling around a queer little line of samples
yesterday while you were there. What was she
hinting about? Eh? What was she saying
one thing for, and meaning something else?
She&#8217;s jollying Campe, that&#8217;s plain to me; but
what&#8217;s this thing she&#8217;s trying to shoulder on to
the little old maid?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a peculiar household,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk.
He went to the table and began turning the leaves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
of one of the books carelessly. Scanlon, glancing
at it, saw an array of skulls of differing formations,
all down one of the pages. &#8220;And,&#8221; resumed the
crime specialist, &#8220;it will probably take some
weighing and judging before we get them properly
placed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leaving the book open, he once more thrust
his hands into his pockets and resumed the
pacing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Music,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is a delightful thing. Its
powers to quiet and to uplift are tremendous.&#8221;
There was a short pause, and then he added:
&#8220;What&#8217;s your opinion of the harp as an
instrument?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Scanlon was very frank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;ve got me bad,&#8221; said he. &#8220;All I
know about it is what I heard a Sicilian do to it
one season in Tucson. He was the orchestra in
&#8216;File&#8217; Brady&#8217;s saloon, and picked melody out of
it to accompany the ballad singers. And,&#8221; here
he looked shrewdly at Ashton-Kirk, &#8220;I know less
about swords that you operate with both hands.
As a weapon, this style of thing had gone out
before I came into the desire to mix it with my
fellow man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I repeat,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that some of the things
we heard and saw held a great deal of interest.
But how are we to associate them? What possible
connection has a delicate gilt harp with a
mysterious noise in the night? What has a green
stone in common with a sword that was carried
in the siege of Milan? And what can there be
between a beautiful woman, radiant with life, and
a creature three-quarters dead, who is wheeled
about in a chair?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>The big, candid face of Scanlon grew stiff with
amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, look here!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Just where
does that fellow&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But at a gesture from the crime specialist he
stopped. And once more Ashton-Kirk paused at
the table; and again he began turning the leaves
of the book.</p>

<p>&#8220;The studies of that ingenious old empiric of
Antwerp, Gall, are most amusing,&#8221; said he, as his
eyes began to run from one pictured skull to
another. &#8220;The system he worked out and which
he called &#8216;Zoonomy&#8217; is rich in suggestion, and,&#8221;
nodding his head, &#8220;may contain more truths than
is generally supposed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He had something to do with skulls, I take
it,&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon.</p>

<p>&#8220;He had all to do with them in this particular
regard, though his system was afterward much
amplified by Spurzheim, and the Englishmen,
George and Andrew Combe. His idea was that
the skull&#8217;s development followed that of the
brain; that certain parts of the brain stood for
certain faculties; if the brain were large in this
faculty the skull would show it. And in that
way we were to have a very convenient method of
judging the character of any particular person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of it,&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon. &#8220;A
fellow I roomed with once used to turn that trick
at a bob a time. It was a fairly easy way of
getting money, but I couldn&#8217;t see very much
more to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw it practised by a fakir,&#8221; said the
special detective, his eyes still upon the turning
pages. &#8220;And such things offer many opportunities
for crooked practitioners. But, after all,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
I don&#8217;t think it would be at all difficult to prove
that it has its basis in truth. It is a well-known
fact that nations, for example, have one general
type of head; and it is equally well known that
the individuals of a nation have the same general
tendencies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here he pushed the book aside and his hand
went to a brace of volumes at the end of the
table.</p>

<p>&#8220;I put in some little time last night,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;dipping into Humboldt and Vater. There is a
vast difference between their keen, uncompromising
intellects and the credulous minds of Gall and
his followers. And yet it is a bit startling to trace
a line between them which runs&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But here he looked up and met the inquiring
look of the big man with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re having a peep behind the scenes,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;You&#8217;re seeing me deep in a mass of preliminary
speculations, and not at all sure as to
where they are to lead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon, with confidence,
&#8220;you see something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very clearly,&#8221; and the keen eyes glittered
with interest, &#8220;but I think I see the mist breaking
away at some points, and before to-day is done
I may be able to get my ranges. Perhaps by the
time I get Fuller&#8217;s second report I&#8217;ll have enough
data to finish the case at a blow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon. He got up and
shook the crime specialist by the hand. &#8220;That
cheers me up. You see,&#8221; earnestly, &#8220;I&#8217;m as
keen on this thing as if it were my own&mdash;maybe
more so. This boy is hard pressed, and has called
on me for help. I don&#8217;t want to fail him. I don&#8217;t
want it proved that he&#8217;s made a mistake.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>&#8220;We&#8217;ll do our best,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk, &#8220;to
pull him through.&#8221;</p>

<p>The big man&#8217;s face wore an anxious look.</p>

<p>&#8220;But just where do I come in?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;While you are deep in the struggle to put this
thing right, what am I to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk, &#8220;is exactly what I
wanted to speak of. Your part in this affair is to
be important. Watch! Sleep&mdash;as some of the
naturalists say the wild things do&mdash;with your eyes
open. Things are apt to happen inside Schwartzberg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Inside,&#8221; said Scanlon. &#8220;But what about
outside?&#8221;</p>

<p>The other smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, as to that,&#8221; said he, &#8220;suppose you leave
the outside to me.&#8221;</p>

<small>SHOWS HOW MR. SCANLON MET THE MAN WITH
THE SOFT VOICE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was late in the afternoon when Bat Scanlon
got off the train at Marlowe Furnace and
struck down the little road toward the
covered bridge.</p>

<p>Upon the west bank he held to the regular road
toward Schwartzberg; and he had gone perhaps
half the distance when he heard hoof beats behind
him; turning, he recognized Grace Knowles,
mounted upon a powerful grey horse.</p>

<p>She waved her whip to him, smilingly, and as
she came up, drew in her mount.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very pleasant afternoon,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>Bat cast his eyes first at one point and then at
another. The question, it would appear, was a
weighty one and must be carefully considered.
The sun touched the hilltops with a dull gold;
the sky was filled with sailing ribbons of white;
and the breeze was bracing and free.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty good,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Reminds me of
some of the afternoons we used to have in the
foot-hills when they were dragging the railroads
over them, and through them, and alongside
of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Campe has been telling me of some of
your experiences,&#8221; said she, her beautiful face
filled with interest. &#8220;It must have been a very
wild life, there in the West in those days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was all of that,&#8221; replied Bat, as he trudged
along beside the grey. &#8220;Wild is the word that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
just fits it. A fellow had to sleep with his guns
in his hands and a call for help in his mouth. We
had some fine, enterprising lads out that way.
They&#8217;d go for anything, and stop at nothing.
But,&#8221; with a sigh, &#8220;it was tame enough before I
pulled out. Things seemed to have shifted,
somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221; asked Miss Knowles.</p>

<p>&#8220;The West having taken to growing grain and
feeding sheep, the East seems to be providing the
excitement necessary for the country&#8217;s good,&#8221;
stated the big man, calmly. &#8220;For example:
I&#8217;ve see more little proceedings around this village
of Marlowe Furnace than I&#8217;ve seen in some frontier
towns with the hardest kind of names.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You refer to what happened yesterday in the
vaults,&#8221; said Miss Knowles. &#8220;Yes, that must
have been quite thrilling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was also a bit dangerous,&#8221; said Bat,
stoically. &#8220;I don&#8217;t object to being shot at, mind
you; but I do want to see the party that&#8217;s got the
matter in hand. This having surprise packages
dealt one in the dark is carrying the matter too far.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Knowles smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt,&#8221; she said, very calmly, &#8220;it seems
rather awkward.&#8221; There was a pause, and she
stroked the horse&#8217;s neck with her whip. &#8220;I
suppose your friend was also startled,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Almost into fits,&#8221; stated Bat. &#8220;He&#8217;s a
fellow, you see, who&#8217;s not used to such attentions;
and to have them forced on him suddenly in that
way was too much for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Knowles still smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is really too bad,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Being so
abruptly treated,&#8221; inquiringly, &#8220;I suppose he will
not come again?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>&#8220;You never can tell,&#8221; replied Scanlon.
&#8220;Sometimes people take things to heart; and
again they laugh them off, like a pine-snake does
his worn-out jacket. You might never catch him
within ten miles of Schwartzberg again; and then
he might walk in on us this very night.&#8221;</p>

<p>The smile vanished from the beautiful face;
and the blue eyes looked at the big man steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-night,&#8221; she said, and there was a catch in
her voice. Then, quietly enough, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think
Mr. Campe expects him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Ashton-Kirk is not the fellow to stand
back for a little thing like that,&#8221; remarked Bat
Scanlon. &#8220;As a matter of fact, the time that
he&#8217;s not expected is more than likely to be the
time he&#8217;d pick.&#8221;</p>

<p>From somewhere over the rolling country a bell
struck the hour. At once the girl gathered her
reins tighter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must hurry on,&#8221; she said. She waved her
whip as the grey struck into a long, easy gallop;
and away they went down the road toward the
castle. The thoughtful eyes of Mr. Scanlon
followed her until both horse and rider were
hidden behind the next rise of ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;She knows Kirk,&#8221; thought he with a twist at
the corner of his mouth, and a sharp nod of the
head. &#8220;She knew his name as soon as she heard
it, and she guessed what he came for. And now
she&#8217;s anxious to know when he&#8217;s coming again, is
she? When I hint that he might bob up to-night
she takes fire, and goes off like a shot.&#8221; Here his
eyes snapped sharply and he went on: &#8220;And
what is the answer to so much agitation? Is
something doing for this <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>? Does the beautiful
Miss Knowles know it; does she think the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
horning in of a party of A-K.&#8217;s intelligence might
have awkward results?&#8221;</p>

<p>As he proceeded along the road, Mr. Scanlon
drew a tobacco pouch from his pocket, also a
packet of small papers, and formally rolled himself
a cigarette. With this properly lighted, he
went calmly on, his brows level and his expectations
at their highest.</p>

<p>&#8220;At first,&#8221; meditated he, &#8220;I took this thing in
another way. It was all worry. But now that
I&#8217;ve shifted the responsibility to Kirk, I see it
differently. It&#8217;s an experience&mdash;an adventure.
And, believe me, I&#8217;m going to get out of it all
there is in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he reached the rise which the girl had
ridden over, he sighted a small road which his
tramping trips had told him led down to the
river. By the side of this road, writing in a
leather-covered book, was a man. He was a fat
man and soft-looking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon, &#8220;Who&#8217;s this?&#8221;</p>

<p>With much industry, the stranger wrote in the
little book; and never once did he lift his head.
Scanlon halted.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something tells me,&#8221; was his thought,
&#8220;that I have met with this gentleman upon some
past occasion. But where?&#8221;</p>

<p>The little lane was one of the retiring sort; it
had fallen oak leaves covering it to the depth of
one&#8217;s shoe tops; the crooked rail fences gave it a
homely look.</p>

<p>The man with the book paused in his writing,
and then went carefully over what had been
done; it did not seem to please him, and so he
began some alterations in the entry.</p>

<p>Then, glancing up, he sighted Scanlon, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
moved toward him softly. When he spoke his
voice was also soft.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a stranger,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And I fear I&#8217;ve
lost my way. Can you direct me to the station at
Marlowe Furnace?&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that Bat had him placed! There was
something reminiscent in the combination of
softness, even at first glance; but the mention of
the railway station placed the tag upon him. It
was the man whom the old station agent had
described&mdash;the man of the bridge&mdash;the man who
had given him the queer green stone.</p>

<p>Quietly the big man blew out a thin spiral of
smoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;You go down this road,&#8221; said he, &#8220;until
you come to a bridge. This you cross. Ten
minutes further on, and there you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>The soft-looking man closed the leather-covered
book; then he put it away carefully in one pocket,
and the pencil in another.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am extremely obliged to you,&#8221; he said,
gently. &#8220;Your directions, I think, will be very
easy to follow.&#8221; He stroked his white soft chin
with a hand that was equally thick and soft and
white; and his eyes searched Scanlon&#8217;s face.
&#8220;You live hereabouts, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the time being,&#8221; replied Bat, evenly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a nice kind of a place, and I&#8217;m sticking
around a while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, to be sure,&#8221; observed the soft man.
&#8220;You are right. It is a nice place. Very picturesque,
and also very historical, I understand.&#8221;
He waved one hand in a stubby gesture toward
the north. &#8220;I came that way. And just above
I saw a most astonishing house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Big one?&#8221; asked Bat. &#8220;Things on top?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>&#8220;A very big one,&#8221; agreed the other. &#8220;Very
big, indeed; and, as you say, with things on the
top.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Schwartzberg,&#8221; said Bat. &#8220;A
German castle, only not in Germany. The rule is
to plant them along the Rhine, I believe, but the
fellow who put this one in must have thought one
river as good as another. And I agree with
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The soft man laughed. If anything, his laugh
was the softest thing about him. As Bat listened
to the laugh, and looked at the man&#8217;s eyes, which
were green and cold and steady, he felt his scalp
prickle with something like dread. But he puffed
quietly at his cigarette; and, from his manner,
such a feeling was no nearer to him than the poles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, to be sure,&#8221; said the soft-looking
man. &#8220;He was quite right. It is very stately&mdash;most
charming, and adds to the picturesqueness
of the locality.&#8221; From where they stood the
towers of Schwartzberg were to be seen through
the naked trees; and one fat, white finger pointed
to them. &#8220;The moon, now,&#8221; said the man,
&#8220;must play about those portions of the building
very strikingly when it is at its full.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t wonder,&#8221; said Bat.</p>

<p>&#8220;In fact,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;night hereabouts
must be very different in many ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;As to that,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know but what
I agree with you. It <i>is</i> different.&#8221;</p>

<p>The soft man moved softly nearer; there was
an eagerness under his smooth manner that was
not lost upon Scanlon.</p>

<p>&#8220;I love the night,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It is rather an
old-fashioned thing to do, I admit; but I love it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
for all that. In these times when the electric
lights have robbed the heavens of their stars, and
put out the very moon, there are few who admire
the night. But I love to walk in it, to watch the
canopy, to reflect upon the vastness of the
universe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was brought up in Kansas,&#8221; said Bat, &#8220;and
in the days when there was no end of stars,
plenty of moon, and lots of chance for them to
show themselves. But to me, night was made to
sleep in, and the only use I had for either moon
or stars was to see my way home by, if I happened
to be out after hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it possible that you never walk out&mdash;here?&#8221;
The soft man seemed appalled, but the
cold green eyes were as watchful as those of a
cat. &#8220;Is it possible that you never hear&mdash;from
your window, perhaps&mdash;the whispering of the
night?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whispering,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Well, if that&#8217;s
whispering, let me say that the night has some
well developed voice. Up here,&#8221; he added, &#8220;it&#8217;s
the greatest place for thunder you ever saw.
It comes up when you never expect it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thunder!&#8221; said the soft man; and the cold
eyes seemed to smile.</p>

<p>Bat nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty loud, too,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And as for
taking little walks at night&mdash;well, that&#8217;s hardly
the thing to do hereabouts. You see, there&#8217;s a lot
of tramps about; and they make it a little dangerous.
A friend of mine up at the big place you
were just talking about,&#8221; and Scanlon gestured
toward the castle, &#8220;is kept on the jump all the
time by them. They&#8217;re very forward; even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
undertake a little housebreaking now and then,
he says.&#8221;</p>

<p>The soft man caressed one hand with the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well,&#8221; he sighed, &#8220;everything has its
drawbacks. I suppose it&#8217;s too much to hope for
complete tranquillity. I thank you, sir, for your
courtesy. Straight on, did you say? and then
across the bridge? Again, thank you. You are
very kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so the soft-looking man moved softly
down the road, and Bat stood looking after him
from beneath puckered brows.</p>

<small>TELLS HOW THE NIGHT BREEZE BLEW FROM THE
NORTHWEST</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AT dinner that evening Scanlon was surprised
to find Miss Hohenlo. She wore
a faded little smile and nodded girlishly
to the trainer.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is such a task for me to dress,&#8221; she told
him. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I so seldom come down of an
evening. But the coming of your friend yesterday,
and what Frederic has been telling me about
him is quite exciting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat raised his brows inquiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Telling you about him?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know he mentioned his interest in old
Count Hohenlo,&#8221; said Campe. &#8220;My aunt is
pleased with that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Bat, and felt more at ease. Happening
to turn his eyes in the midst of his complacency,
he found those of Miss Knowles fixed
upon him observantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your friend, Mr. Ashton-Kirk, must be a man
of much learning,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has so many books that it&#8217;d give you a
headache just to look at them,&#8221; said Bat. &#8220;As a
child, they fed him learning with a spoon. He
knows more inside stuff about people whom ordinary
people never heard of than you&#8217;d think
could be found out in half-a-dozen lifetimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How very interesting,&#8221; said Miss Knowles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only to-day he was overhauling a group of
musty old fellows who, so it would seem, put in
their lives poking around among skulls.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Miss Knowles said this, and her hands
went up in a pretty gesture, apparently of dismay.
But Bat, somehow, was quite sure it was to hide
the expression that swept across her face. However,
he went on, calmly:</p>

<p>&#8220;To find a dome that was fore and aft, or to
put the tape around one that leaned to one side,
was life&#8217;s extreme limit for those chaps. They
even seem to have written books about bumps
which any fairly strong man could pack into the
thumb of a lady&#8217;s glove.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And is your friend also interested in this
study?&#8221; asked the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a little,&#8221; replied Scanlon. &#8220;He does
not make a practice of any one thing, as a matter
of fact. He&#8217;s the kind of a fellow who has a
great many cards up his sleeve; and so he always
has one to play when it&#8217;s wanted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Miss Knowles, &#8220;is clever of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s so unusual to find a man interested
in biographical bypaths,&#8221; said Miss Hohenlo.
&#8220;The Count, you know, figured largely in the
court of Frederic the Great; he was a friend to
Voltaire and other men of note, and gave his
sword and his genius for the freedom of these
states.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Bat. &#8220;He&#8217;s one that I missed,
but I can appreciate him for all that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The delicate hands went out in a gesture extremely
girlish; the spinster&#8217;s faded face was
full of rapture.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is really remarkable how things come
about,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and, somehow, I feel that the
visit of Mr. Ashton-Kirk will result in something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure it will,&#8221; said Bat, calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Frederic has been gathering documents for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
long time,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;I have a number of
journals containing data of a most interesting
character, and there are letters without number
from historical personages. These together will
show the beautiful fulness of the Count&#8217;s life.
When your friend comes again, we must not fail
to call his attention to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the next visit he&#8217;ll not miss a thing,&#8221;
stated Scanlon, confidently.</p>

<p>As they arose from the table Miss Hohenlo went
to a window, raised it and looked out over the
country, now dimming under the hand of dusk.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Schwartzberg had nothing else in its
favour,&#8221; she said, vivaciously, &#8220;we could always
fall back upon the glorious weather. And to-night,&#8221;
with a gesture of the beautiful hands,
&#8220;is more than usually splendid.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she stood there, framed in the high window,
the spinster looked even more angular than Scanlon
had supposed her to be. Her faded hair
threw back nothing that the lamp-light gave it;
her neck was thin, her arms were long and awkward.
Near her stood the stately Miss Knowles,
magnificent in her youth, her height, her long soft
lines. The girl&#8217;s complexion was more like cream
and roses than ever; the splendid crown of yellow
hair was built up in a shining mass.</p>

<p>Striking as was her beauty, and much as he
would have liked to stand and admire it, Bat
Scanlon&#8217;s interest was called to something else.
The actions of Miss Hohenlo at the window were
commonplace enough, and yet, somehow, Miss
Knowles seemed to attach much importance to
them. The girl stood talking with Campe. Their
tones were low; and the young man&#8217;s face had
lost the strained look. The fear, which usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
held its place so fixedly in his eyes, was gone for
the time, and an eagerness had replaced it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine for him!&#8221; was Bat&#8217;s mental comment.
&#8220;If it don&#8217;t do anything else, the entertainment
will rest him up for a little, and that&#8217;s something.
And,&#8221; here his mouth twisted slightly at the
corner, &#8220;the lady is as interested as he is, but
not at the same thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a subtle something going on which
the big man did not grasp; that it was proceeding
was plain enough; but its meaning was lost upon
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m muffing it,&#8221; was his thought. &#8220;Right
under it, too. It must be,&#8221; sadly, &#8220;that the
grand stand&#8217;s too big; a minor leaguer never
does get a right slant at anything until he&#8217;s out
of the bush for a season. Kirk ought to be here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How deep the shadows grow on the east of
the hills,&#8221; remarked Miss Hohenlo, sentimentally.
&#8220;I love to watch them as they thicken and
lengthen in the evening.&#8221; She leaned farther
from the window, a hand outstretched. &#8220;There
is only the faintest of breezes,&#8221; she continued,
&#8220;so little that one can scarcely detect its
direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this, the watching Scanlon saw the blue eyes
of Miss Knowles narrow; the look of interest upon
her face deepened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now it&#8217;s the wind,&#8221; said Bat, to himself.
&#8220;And I am up to my eyebrows for sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Frederic,&#8221; and Miss Hohenlo turned to her
nephew, &#8220;see if you can catch the wind&#8217;s
direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obediently the young man left the side of Miss
Knowles.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s from the northwest, I think,&#8221; said he.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
&#8220;Yes, look there. Those tall birches are stirring;
you can see their tops against the sky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What wonderful sight you have, my dear,&#8221;
said his aunt, as she fixed her eye-glasses upon
her insignificant nose, and strove to see the tree
tops he mentioned. &#8220;You must inherit it from
your father&#8217;s family, for ours have never seen
very clearly.&#8221; She looked out into the dusk
with much affectation of fear. &#8220;Oh, dear, isn&#8217;t
it very lonely out there?&#8221; she said. &#8220;Darkness
does make such a change, doesn&#8217;t it, Mr. Scanlon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One time,&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon, &#8220;when I had
nothing else to do, I took a short whirl at a
theatrical enterprise in Dodge City. And that
showed me something fresh about the effects of
darkness. Flood the stage with light and you
couldn&#8217;t stir a thrill in the audience, no matter to
what histrionic lengths you went. But put on the
shadows and you began to get them; shut off the
lights altogether, and you could feel things creeping
right over the footlights.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you really?&#8221; Miss Hohenlo was extremely
juvenile in her gestures of terror. &#8220;It
must have been dreadful!&#8221; Then to her nephew:
&#8220;You are quite sure it&#8217;s from the northwest,
Frederic?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, quite sure,&#8221; replied the young man a
trifle impatiently. He had gone back to the girl
once more and taken up the low-pitched conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said Miss Hohenlo, &#8220;it might
change.&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Campe did not hear this, so Mr. Scanlon
said, reassuringly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to-night it won&#8217;t. It&#8217;ll stick around
that quarter till sunrise, anyway.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it delightful to understand the laws of
Nature?&#8221; said Miss Hohenlo. &#8220;I never had a
head for it, really.&#8221;</p>

<p>A very few moments later she moved out of the
room; Scanlon, with a nod and a half-spoken
excuse, left the girl and Campe together. Descending
the stone stairs, he let himself out into
the courtyard, and lighting a cigar he began
walking up and down.</p>

<p>The square figure of the German sergeant-major
was to be seen upon the wall; there was
something intent in his attitude, indistinct though
he was.</p>

<p>&#8220;A good watch-dog,&#8221; mused Bat, as he puffed
away. &#8220;But, dash it, I don&#8217;t get him! A fellow
like that is useful if you know he belongs to you;
but when you get to thinking that he might&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
Here the big man paused and took the cigar from
his mouth. &#8220;What happened to that lamp in
the vaults yesterday?&#8221; he demanded of himself.
&#8220;What did it smash for? It wasn&#8217;t till afterward
that there were any pistol shots.&#8221; He
snapped his finger and thumb with a sharp popping
sound. &#8220;I wonder if Kirk thought of that,&#8221;
he said in a low tone. &#8220;I&#8217;ll mention it to him
when I see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the cigar burning freely, and his hands
clasped behind him, Scanlon trudged up and
down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wind from the northwest, eh?&#8221; thought he.
&#8220;That&#8217;s a funny kind of thing. There was something
to it, though. I could read it in that girl&#8217;s
face as plainly as I can read print. The old one
seemed to want to be sure just how the wind
blew; and the young one seemed interested in
the desire. Wonder what kind of a little game<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
it is, and how does it work into the bigger one
that&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</p>

<p>He mused and smoked and paced, but the affair
presented no aspects at all understandable.
Finally, in exasperation, Bat began a conversation
with the man on the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nice night,&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; came the brief reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think it&#8217;ll rain?&#8221; asked Bat.</p>

<p>&#8220;The wind&#8217;s from the northwest,&#8221; stated the
sergeant-major.</p>

<p>Bat bit at his cigar viciously. Though not able
to give any good reason for it, he wished it would
select some other quarter.</p>

<p>&#8220;The northwest!&#8221; said he, to himself.
&#8220;What the dickens is there about the northwest
that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; here he stopped, a thought taking shape
in his mind. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go out,&#8221; said he, gravely.
&#8220;There might be something doing, out that way;
and if no one&#8217;s there it might break out.&#8221;</p>

<p>He called once more to Kretz.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; answered the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come down,&#8221; requested Bat, &#8220;and open the
gate. I want to go out.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant-major descended from the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;To go out,&#8221; stated he, &#8220;is not wise. Outside
there is danger&mdash;from the tramps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unbolt the gate,&#8221; said Bat, serenely. &#8220;I
rather like tramps. In fact, one of the regrets of
my young life is that I&#8217;ve met so few of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the cellar,&#8221; said Kretz, as he shot back a
bolt, &#8220;they fired at us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; suggested Bat, &#8220;that volley ran
them out of ammunition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not know how much they are to be
feared,&#8221; said the German, stubbornly. &#8220;I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
served. I have seen danger. But,&#8221; and Bat
saw his head shake, &#8220;never any like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-night,&#8221; said the big man, &#8220;I feel like
taking a chance. Stick around, will you, so you
can let me in when I get back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reluctantly the sergeant-major opened the
gate; then he closed it promptly and Bat, from
the outside, heard him refastening it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it that he is anxious that nothing should
happen to me; or is it that he wants nothing to
happen to something else?&#8221; reflected Bat, as he
threw away the cigar, and stood by the gate looking
away into the night. &#8220;Little anxieties like
that might work both ways, as I&#8217;ve seen to my
cost.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slowly and quietly he passed around the wall,
and at a point overlooking the northwest he
paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Potomac at its quietest could never
compare with this,&#8221; said he, gently. &#8220;It&#8217;s as
peaceful, apparently, as a pastoral on a post-card.
All it needs is a glint of moon, a fleecy cloud, and
a happy pair of lovers.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a serene, quiet night; the wind from
the northwest was but the merest puff; the
shadowy hills lay long and looming on every
side; the stars were few and seemed very far
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s on these still nights, though,&#8221; ruminated
Bat, &#8220;that things that make a noise usually have
their beginnings. Some wise old lad, in the days
gone by, came through with a remark about the
calm before the storm; and as an observer, I&#8217;ll
say that he held aces. Because it&#8217;s always been
my experience that your man always takes his
longest rest before he comes at you with both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
hands swinging. So the right rule must be:
the quieter the night, the wider you should keep
your eyes open.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then he turned his head and looked up at
the castle. At an open window he saw something
move. It was a woman in white&mdash;a tall
woman. Bat&#8217;s straining eyes made her out.</p>

<p>&#8220;The young one,&#8221; said he, softly.</p>

<p>The window was dark, but the white of the
gown was distinct; and the outlines, vague though
they were, were unmistakable. And she seemed
to be looking out over the swelling country toward
the northwest.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are events to be looked for, as I
thought,&#8221; murmured Mr. Scanlon. &#8220;Doings are
being started just as sure as she stands in that
window.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned his eyes away from the shadowy
window and toward the equally shadowy quarter
which held the girl&#8217;s attention. For a space all
was alike; it seemed evenly dark. Then he
began to perceive points of light between the
hills; these were low places in the western sky
which the night had not stained completely
black. Against one of these, Bat, as he looked,
caught a movement; some slinking, peculiar
figures crossed it and were at once swallowed up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; muttered Mr. Scanlon, grimly.
&#8220;Just stay still for a little, and I&#8217;ll be with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that he quietly descended the slope of
the hill upon which Schwartzberg stood, and made
off into the darkness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<small>IN WHICH SOME THINGS ARE DONE AND SOME
OTHERS ARE SAID</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS Bat went cautiously onward, the place
where he had seen the movement marked
in his mind, he was aware of a glimmering
of light over his shoulder. Turning his head he
saw the rim of the moon pushing its way above
the trees behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Here&#8217;s our friend with
the smiling face, and I don&#8217;t know whether I&#8217;m
glad to see him or not.&#8221; He stood gazing at the
disc, which mounted rapidly, throwing its cold
rays along the hills. &#8220;Anyway,&#8221; continued Bat,
philosophically, &#8220;I caught him over my right
shoulder, and that means a run of luck. So with
things fixed in my favour, I&#8217;d better go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keeping as much in the shadow as possible, he
went his way. After a time he drew near to a
hill, higher than any of those about it, from which
he had more than once admired the ancient
looking towers of Schwartzberg.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;d better top that,&#8221; he muttered,
&#8220;and take an observation. If there&#8217;s any one
moving around out here I&#8217;ll be able to spot him in
the moonshine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carefully he ascended the rather steep side of
the hill; the lessons of his youth, when he trailed
a Geronimo in the southwest or stalked &#8220;Billy-the-Kid&#8221;
were as clear in his mind as ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the joints don&#8217;t work the same,&#8221; was the
big man&#8217;s mental complaint. &#8220;They creak
enough to waken any fairly light sleeper, if
there were such camped in this vicinity.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>He came to the top of the hill, and standing in
the shadow of a tree, looked about. The long,
trailing moonbeams and the dusky shadows lay
side by side, as far as he could see. There was a
path which wound up the west side of the hill,
down on the east and away toward the river; as
Bat looked westward along this it disappeared in
the shadows which clung to the slope. And he
heard a sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Voices,&#8221; said he. Then, after a moment,
&#8220;Voices and wheels.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quietly he waited and listened. Away to the
east he saw the ghostlike loom of Schwartzberg in
the moonlight; the breeze stirred the bare limbs
of the trees under which he stood.</p>

<p>Bat smiled as he looked up at the branches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still from the northwest,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Well,
hold to it. Maybe you&#8217;ll bring us something.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the sound of wheels&mdash;singularly
light wheels. And the stumbling hoofs
of the usual horse were absent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can it be some one doing a little hill climbing
on a bicycle?&#8221; was the big man&#8217;s silent question.
&#8220;If so, he has an original turn of mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>But in a few moments more a shape emerged
from the shadows, coming up the hill. It was a
rolling chair; in it was a muffled figure and
behind it laboured a squat, strong-looking servant.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; was Bat&#8217;s mental exclamation.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the sick fellow from the inn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon reaching the crest of the hill the chair
stopped. The squat servant spoke to the invalid
inquiringly, but in a strange tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lift me up,&#8221; directed the man in the chair.</p>

<p>The stocky one did as directed; the patient
turned his face toward the castle, and his eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
remained fixed upon it for a long time. The
breeze moved softly; there was scarcely a sound
to be heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been here before,&#8221; mused Bat, from the
shadow of the tree. &#8220;And it&#8217;s not been for air,
either.&#8221; Then Ashton-Kirk and his array of
pictured skulls occurred to the watcher, and he
gazed at the peculiar frontal formation of the
sick man with attention. &#8220;I wonder,&#8221; was his
next thought, &#8220;how Kirk doped it out that this
fellow was in on our affair? and I also wonder
what a skull with a flat place in front&#8217;s got to
do with it?&#8221;</p>

<p>After a time Bat saw that the pale hands of the
invalid were moving as though he were fumbling
impatiently with his wrappings. Then, for a
space, he&#8217;d remain perfectly still; as the pale
moon shone directly upon his face, Bat noted that
his eyes during these periods of stillness were
closed. But once more they&#8217;d open and again the
wasted hands would begin to stir in the same
impatient way. During the spaces in which the
sick man sat with closed eyes, the watcher often
saw his face twitch suddenly; and once he
laughed out, clear and loud.</p>

<p>For the space of half an hour this continued;
then there was a long period during which the
sick one sat as though he were thinking. Then
he spoke quietly to his servant; promptly the man
lowered him to a reclining position, turned the
chair about and wheeled it carefully away in the
direction from which they came.</p>

<p>Amazed, Bat stood beneath the friendly tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I wonder what&#8217;s all that?
There is something on the range, that&#8217;s sure; but
as far as my memory goes it&#8217;s the queerest bit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
business I ever witnessed. There he sits with his
eyes shut, and makes faces at the moon. And
the lad that pushes him around instead of calling
for an ambulance seems to think it a perfectly
natural proceeding.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scanlon gazed once more in the direction of
Schwartzberg; a spot of yellow light winked here
and there from a window; but otherwise the great
place, lit as it was by the moon, seemed paler and
more ghostly than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;If that was a winter moon, and there was
snow on the ground, and the Christmas bells were
ringing in the distance,&#8221; mused Bat, &#8220;I&#8217;d understand
why I feel as I do. Those trees over there
would be the Black Forest; there would be a
small bright place among them showing the
charcoal burners at work; and in a couple of
minutes along would come a little old man with a
white beard and a bundle of faggots on his back.
Then I&#8217;d know I was six years old and reading a
story-book. But being a man and grown to some
size, I&#8217;m up in the air.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stepped out from the shadow of the tree,
and throwing his arms wide, yawned luxuriously.
Then he realized that several men stood beside
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said Bat, and brought the yawn to
an abrupt termination. &#8220;How are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>One was the drawn-looking man whom he and
Ashton-Kirk had seen at the inn; the other was
the brisk little physician whom they had seen
upon the same occasion.</p>

<p>The drawn-looking man stood with stooped
shoulders and regarded Bat with wondering eyes.
Then he coughed into a handkerchief.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very brilliant night,&#8221; suggested he.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>&#8220;Great!&#8221; replied Bat.</p>

<p>The little physician fixed his eye-glasses firmly
upon his nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a night,&#8221; stated he, &#8220;for being outdoors.
As a matter of fact, any night, or any day, are
excellent for that purpose. The warm-blooded
animal requires great quantities of those forces
which the air holds for his use; and to get them
he must go where it is. Otherwise he&#8217;ll be ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds like a very good argument,&#8221;
observed Bat, calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a rule,&#8221; stated the doctor, and he regarded
Bat through his lenses, &#8220;my patients resent the
idea of outdoors. They look at it askance.
There is the suggestion of hardship in the mere
idea. They want to be coddled in a room full of
poisonous vapours.&#8221; Still he looked at the big
man fixedly; then he continued, &#8220;You are not of
sickly habit, I think, and so you require no
urging to take the air.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit,&#8221; replied Scanlon. &#8220;To-night, as
a matter of fact,&#8221; his mind running back to the
words of Kretz, &#8220;I was strongly urged to stay
indoors.&#8221;</p>

<p>The drawn man coughed; he looked extremely
fragile in the pale light; his face was bloodless,
and his eyes had a feverish glint.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the main, the doctor is correct in his
observations,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But for all, I can&#8217;t
help thinking there <i>are</i> times when one should
stay inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat waited a moment, expecting a protest from
the physician; but none came; that gentleman
was engaged with the moonlit landscape.</p>

<p>&#8220;And such times?&#8221; asked Bat. &#8220;Just what
are they like?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>The drawn man wiped his lips, and his thin,
bowed shoulders shrugged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps one&#8217;s own discretion is best as to
that,&#8221; said he, mildly. &#8220;But, for the sake of an
example, a skipper does not venture to sea in the
face of a storm; a mountaineer keeps from the
passes in the season of snows; a careful man does
not force his way into those things which do not
concern him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I get you,&#8221; said Bat, thoughtfully. &#8220;But I
also see some holes in your argument. It&#8217;s not
nearly so good as the doctor&#8217;s spiel for fresh air.
The skipper, if he&#8217;s on his job and has the craft,
has no right to let a blow keep him in bed; and
I&#8217;ve seen real two-handed lads hold to the passes
in all weathers. So far as the careful man is
concerned&mdash;well, different people have different
ideas about what makes up a man of that kind.
Your notion of one seems to be a man who
wouldn&#8217;t take a chance except in his own affairs.
But, in my little book, he&#8217;s written down as one
who&#8217;d think his friend&#8217;s affair just as important&mdash;and
he&#8217;d be just as anxious to set it right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said the doctor, turning, &#8220;we&#8217;d
better make our way down to the road. The
moon, in a few moments, will be under the clouds,
and the path is rather steep.&#8221;</p>

<p>The drawn man coughed and nodded to Mr.
Scanlon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Now that you <i>are</i>
out,&#8221; and he smiled disagreeably, &#8220;I trust you&#8217;ll
enjoy yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; replied the big man, coolly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
always had kind of a knack of doing that; so I
shouldn&#8217;t wonder if I did.&#8221;</p>

<small>SHOWS HOW MRS. KRETZ SPOKE HER MIND</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BAT SCANLON stood for a space under the
neighbourly tree; he could hear the drawn
man coughing away into the gloom at the
foot of the hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; observed he, &#8220;am I indeed over my
head. Not only have we one man in this little
matter who is so far through that he must be
shoved along in a chair, but here comes another
who goes wheezing around on one lung and
throwing hints of a threatening nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>He slipped an automatic pistol from his hip
pocket&mdash;a black, bulky, deadly thing; and he
smoothed it with a feeling of satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hints are all very well,&#8221; he went on; &#8220;but
they never did any harm, and they never got
anybody anything. Doing&#8217;s what counts; and
all I&#8217;ve got to say is, let somebody start doing
something I don&#8217;t like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thinking it just as well to move from the spot
he then occupied, Bat, pistol in hand, made his
way along the crest of the hill and struck into a
path which was to some extent shaded from the
moon&#8217;s rays. He had a very clear recollection of
the brisk rattle of shots in the vaults on the day
before, and he had no desire to court another
such.</p>

<p>But he picked his way along through the rising
ground without mischance; the river gleamed
coldly and smoothly; the walls and towers of
Schwartzberg looked darker at close hand, and
lost the ghostly, transparent quality which they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
had taken from the distance. Bat was somewhat
disappointed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here I take a gentleman&#8217;s promise&mdash;for that&#8217;s
what it really was&mdash;of some entertainment. I
even think enough of it to draw a gun, and pick
the covered spots. And now there&#8217;s nothing
doing. What the dickens is the world coming to
when a fellow can&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a loud splash from the river close
by; looking quickly in that direction Bat saw a
bulky form stumbling about in the shallows under
a bank. Two other forms instantly appeared and
steadied the burly one; then all disappeared like
a flash.</p>

<p>&#8220;The curtain,&#8221; observed Bat, grimly, &#8220;is a
little late in rising; but it seems we&#8217;re going to
have a show after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Holding to the shadow thrown by the high
wall, he made his way cautiously toward the
spot. On the edge of the shadow he paused, but
there was no sound; so, with his automatic held
ready, he stepped out into the light and advanced
toward the bank. A broken place was plain; but
no one was in sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;The big fellow stood too close to the edge;
then the thing caved in and let him down into the
water,&#8221; reasoned Bat. &#8220;But,&#8221; and his gaze went
about, &#8220;what&#8217;s become of him and the parties
who offered the helping hand in his time of need?&#8221;</p>

<p>The river bank was clear of all obstructions for
some distance above and below Schwartzberg;
the moonlight flooded it; there was no place where
any one could hide.</p>

<p>&#8220;That being the case, and the prowling parties
not being in sight, I think I&#8217;ll step back where I
can&#8217;t be so readily seen,&#8221; said the big man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>He had turned about and was moving away
from the river when a rifle sounded; clear against
the moonlit sky he made out Kretz upon the
wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said Scanlon, his hands at his mouth
like a megaphone. &#8220;That&#8217;ll be about all of
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant-major lowered his gun, and stood
looking down; and within a few minutes the big
man was at the gate and hammering to be let in.</p>

<p>Kretz admitted him, sullen-faced and silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you always take a look,&#8221; spoke
Scanlon, after the gate had been closed and
fastened, &#8220;a good look, mind you, before you
cut loose with that gun of yours. And let this be
especially the case when I&#8217;m known to be outside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twice to-night have I seen people near the
river before I saw you. Each time I called, but
they said nothing. The third time I fired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And <i>I</i> just happened along in time to be the
goat,&#8221; grumbled Bat. Then, with a sharp side
glance at the sergeant-major&#8217;s grim face, he
added mentally, as he turned away, &#8220;That is, if
you <i>didn&#8217;t know</i> who it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inside he found the room where he usually
spent the evenings with Campe deserted. But
from another apartment the voice of Miss
Knowles was heard laughing, and that of Campe
answered with much animation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come now,&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon, &#8220;if it was
somebody other than that blonde girl who was
with him I&#8217;d say that this wasn&#8217;t half bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>An atmosphere of change was about the rooms
which had been so gloomy; for the first time since
he had been there, fear was sharing the centre of
the stage with something else.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>&#8220;If I&#8217;d only thought of Ashton-Kirk sooner,&#8221;
said Bat, &#8220;the whole thing might have been
straightened out by now. His just coming here
for an hour, and Campe not even knowing who
he was, has put a new face on things.&#8221;</p>

<p>He wandered about among the lower rooms for
a time, and finally began to run through the books
in the library.</p>

<p>But none of them pleased him, for it seemed
a time for action; so shutting the bookcase door,
he turned away; and then he saw Kretz&#8217;s
daughter beckoning to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; said he, staring.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother,&#8221; said the girl, stolidly. &#8220;She is
in the kitchen. She wants you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she vanished. For a few moments Mr.
Scanlon continued his stare&mdash;but now at the
empty doorway. Then with the little twist at the
corner of his mouth, and with something like
interest in his eyes, he made his way toward the
kitchen.</p>

<p>The lamps, hanging from the beamed ceiling,
threw but a dim light about the huge room; a
sullen fire burned in the fireplace; the copper
vessels gleamed dully. Upon a rush-bottomed
chair near the blaze sat Mrs. Kretz. In her strong
hands were some long steel needles, and she was
knitting a stocking of blue wool. She nodded to
Scanlon as he entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lena,&#8221; she said to the girl, &#8220;get a chair.&#8221;</p>

<p>A second rush-bottomed chair was brought
forward by the girl, who then retired to a little
distance and also took up the knitting of a stocking
of blue yarn&mdash;evidently the fellow to the one
her mother was engaged upon.</p>

<p>&#8220;My husband,&#8221; spoke Mrs. Kretz, &#8220;is outside.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
He is watching. He will not be in for some
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; continued the woman, &#8220;while he is not
here, I will have some talk with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon.</p>

<p>&#8220;In this house I have been since spring,&#8221; said
Mrs. Kretz. &#8220;Was it in April, Lena?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was in April,&#8221; agreed Lena.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since spring,&#8221; said Mrs. Kretz. &#8220;And I am
afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>The interest in Mr. Scanlon&#8217;s eyes deepened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of what?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>But the woman gazed at him with an expression
even more wooden than her daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; She laid the knitting on the
hearth beside her and folded her hands in her lap.
&#8220;My husband knows. But my husband never
speaks of things to me. He does not trust
women,&#8221; simply. &#8220;But I am afraid. And Lena
is afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Scanlon leaned forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t only that something is going on which
you don&#8217;t understand that makes you afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman considered this word by word and
then shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;there is more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something has happened&mdash;you&#8217;ve seen it&mdash;maybe
more than once,&#8221; suggested Bat.</p>

<p>The big man had a pretty clear belief that for a
guest to endeavour to worm things out of his host&#8217;s
servants was not altogether decent; but in the
present case he felt that the attempt was justified.</p>

<p>&#8220;There have been many things happened,&#8221;
spoke the woman. &#8220;They began when we first
came, and they have never stopped.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>She sat looking at Bat for a moment, then she
proceeded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know why you are here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never been told, but I&#8217;ve kind of guessed
my way through it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are afraid to tell,&#8221; said Mrs. Kretz.
&#8220;They fear those outside there; and they also
fear the police.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon.</p>

<p>There was a long period of silence, for he felt
that it were best to let her go her own way.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the people outside they watch,&#8221; said Mrs.
Kretz, at length. &#8220;Always outside. But,&#8221; and
the strong hands knotted together suddenly and
her voice sank to a whisper, &#8220;who watches
inside?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Inside?&#8221; said Bat quietly. &#8220;Do we need a
watch inside? Are we not all friends in
Schwartzberg?&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the girl laughed, though she did not look
up from her work. And the laugh was one not
pleasant to hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not know,&#8221; said Mrs. Kretz, and she
shook her head. &#8220;You do not see. One night
since you came,&#8221; and here her voice was lowered
once more, &#8220;a woman screamed. And a shot
was fired. Do you remember?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard both,&#8221; said Bat. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t know
the reason for either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lena was sick&mdash;with her tooth,&#8221; said Mrs.
Kretz. &#8220;I went to speak to my husband. I saw
the door of the vault standing open. And beside
it was Miss Knowles, the key in her hand. I
knew something was about to happen; I ran to
the door to close it. Then the shot came&mdash;from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
below; she screamed; I closed and made fast the
door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is of the family,&#8221; said Mrs. Kretz, &#8220;and
so I never knew how she lied herself out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You feel sure she opened the door, eh?&#8221;
The woman nodded. &#8220;What for, do you suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To allow some one below to come up. But
that thing is not all. Why does she walk about
in the corridors at night? What does she do outside
when all should be asleep but the dogs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw her one night,&#8221; said Lena, speaking
suddenly. &#8220;The night Mr. Campe was hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Bat.</p>

<p>&#8220;On that same night,&#8221; spoke Mrs. Kretz, &#8220;I
was arranging something in the large room where
the pictures are. There was only one small light
burning. I finished my work, and stood by a
window, looking out. There are long curtains at
the window, and these hid me. I felt them stir,
as if in a draught; and I knew the door of the
room had opened. I turned and looked. Miss
Knowles had come in. She crossed the floor very
softly and carefully, and stooped quite near to
me where the great sword hangs between the
windows. She stood looking at this strangely;
then she reached up and took it down. And with
it hidden as much as her wraps would hide it, she
went away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; asked Bat, quietly. But there was
eagerness in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was some hours after that when the great
light flashed and we saw you come staggering
along with Mr. Campe on your back.&#8221; There
was a pause and the woman&#8217;s head rocked from
side to side. &#8220;When he lay wounded out there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
in the darkness, she stood beside him. Didn&#8217;t
you find them so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw the wound. It was I that washed and
dressed it. A great long one, not deep, but fearful
when you thought what it might have been.&#8221;
Again she paused, and looked steadily at Scanlon.
&#8220;It was just such a cut as one could make with a
very long and very heavy weapon,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A
weapon like the sword which hangs between the
windows.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat caught his breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; said he, appalled. &#8220;No!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think a woman couldn&#8217;t do it? Well,
don&#8217;t forget that this one is tall and strong.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat gestured the idea away. He, himself, had
spoken of Miss Knowles and her doings suspiciously.
But now that these suspicions were
voiced by another, and raised to a pitch of unthought
horror, he almost sickened at them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said he, the recollection of many little
glances and accents rushing to his mind, &#8220;she
might even be in love with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is with her,&#8221; corrected the woman. &#8220;And
that, you know, is different.&#8221;</p>

<p>She once more took up the blue stocking and
began to move the needles in and out among the
loops. Lena was stolidly engaged in a like
manner, never having lifted her head since she
began, not even when she herself had spoken.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither of them has any great width between
the hair line and the eyebrows,&#8221; said Bat mentally,
as he looked from one to the other. &#8220;It&#8217;s
the sort of calm that passes all understanding;
and those persons gifted with it usually live
blameless lives.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>The kitchen clock tick-tocked away in its long,
wooden case, as drowsily as need be; the wooden
kitchen things which were in view looked heavy
and commonplace.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, for all they don&#8217;t seem very ready to
grab a thing,&#8221; said Bat, to himself, &#8220;these women
have realized something. And that&#8217;s promising.
Things have happened here, and that&#8217;s the surest
sign that things will continue to happen. And
this pair may turn out to be of use&mdash;if I don&#8217;t
expect too much of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The great fireplace faced the open door of the
kitchen; they all sat facing the fire, and so with
their backs to the door. Bat, with a tight,
strained feeling in his brain, clasped his hands
behind his head and leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;To you, who are a stranger, I say all these
things,&#8221; said Mrs. Kretz, busy with her needles.
&#8220;And it is for this: You have been told nothing&mdash;because
they are afraid. You are Mr. Campe&#8217;s
friend, and went to help him. But how can you
give help where you do not understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>But agreed with this.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said he, his eyes upon a great copper
vessel which stood shining dully from the chimney
piece, &#8220;I could have wished you&#8217;d have some
other sort of information for me. For this puts
me up against something that&#8217;ll be pretty hard to
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The kitchen doorway was reflected in the
sheen of the copper vessel; and, framed in this,
his brooding eyes saw a man. It was a soft,
bulky figure, with white, fat hands and a round
face with small light-coloured eyes. And while he
looked, it moved softly past the doorway and was
gone.</p>

<small>TELLS SOMETHING OF TWO GENTLEMEN WHO WERE
ENCOUNTERED UNEXPECTEDLY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MR. BARTHOLOMEW SCANLON stood up
with much calmness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m obliged to you,&#8221; said he nodding
first to Mrs. Kretz and then to her daughter.
&#8220;And I&#8217;ll think over what you&#8217;ve said. It might
lead to something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is my husband,&#8221; said the elder woman.
&#8220;He thinks women are foolish. You&#8217;ll not speak
to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About this? No. I&#8217;ll mention it to no one.
And,&#8221; pausing in his movement toward the door,
&#8220;if you hear or see anything else which may be
useful to Mr. Campe, don&#8217;t make me wait for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will speak to you at once,&#8221; promised Mrs.
Kretz, intent upon the blue stocking.</p>

<p>In the hall, outside the kitchen door, Bat
Scanlon&#8217;s manner changed. Bulky as he was and
with forty years resting upon him, he was still a
well-conditioned athlete. Slower than he was at
twenty, he was supple enough when he set himself
to it; and now he moved down the hall
swiftly and with the lightness of a boy.</p>

<p>No one was in sight; the first door he came to
stood open; it was a sort of storage room for the
servants, and no one was there. The next door
led to the vaults under the castle; this was closed.
But a turn of the knob showed that it was not
locked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The soft one oozed in by this route,&#8221; thought
Bat, as he closed the door. &#8220;And some thoughtful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
friend prepared the way for him, for witness
the fact that there are bolts on the door, as well
as a lock.&#8221;</p>

<p>Silently he rebolted the door; with some
slivers of wood from the storage room, pointed
with his pocket-knife, he so jammed the bolts that
it would be no easy task to shoot them back.</p>

<p>&#8220;In this way,&#8221; murmured Bat, putting away
the knife, &#8220;I place some small impediment in the
path of the soft party should he desire to back out
of the premises in a hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quietly the big man went through the lower
floor; each room was visited and examined
narrowly. But he found no one; there were no
traces of any one. At the foot of the stairs he
paused; from above came the voice of Campe,
and in it there was lightness and ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;The billiard ball is also merrily clicking,&#8221; said
Mr. Scanlon. &#8220;Evidently he is still engaged
with the golden-haired Helen, and she is making
him forget his troubles.&#8221; He began quietly to
ascend the stairs. &#8220;But it might pay him to
keep an eye open; for who knows when her
ambition might break out afresh, and she might
take another swing at him with the sword.&#8221;</p>

<p>As his head appeared above the landing, he
came in sight of the billiard room door. This was
open and a stream of light flowed out into the
hall. Standing flat against the wall, his back to
the staircase, and peering around the door-frame
into the billiard room was the soft-looking man.</p>

<p>Gently Mr. Scanlon advanced; quietly he
touched the man upon the shoulder; then, as the
head turned, skilfully he chipped him upon the
jaw. The body buckled, and crumpled into a
soft mass in Scanlon&#8217;s arms. Lowering it to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
floor the big man stepped into the doorway. In
the billiard room were Campe and Miss Hohenlo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; said the former with a startled look,
but a manner expressive of relief. &#8220;I <i>thought</i> I
heard somebody shuffling around out there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to speak to you a moment,&#8221; said the
big man, &#8220;if,&#8221; with a glance at the spinster,
&#8220;Miss Hohenlo will pardon us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Hohenlo shook her faded hair and gestured
prettily with her beautiful hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Frederic has so many little secrets of late, and
so many matters he seems anxious to keep from
me, that one, more or less, will make no difference.
I&#8217;ll rehearse my next play while you are gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Campe came out into the hall. Scanlon stood
between him and the body until he closed the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, sit tight,&#8221; admonished the big man,
&#8220;and give me a lift.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a face as grey as ashes, Campe looked at
the senseless man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;And how did he get
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As an answer to the first question, I&#8217;ll say I
don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Scanlon. &#8220;To the second, he
came in by way of the cellar; and the door leading
therefrom was unfastened by some one in the
house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Again!&#8221; Campe looked as though death
itself had clutched him. &#8220;Again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve never thought it wise to put me up in
these affairs of yours,&#8221; said Scanlon, &#8220;so I&#8217;ll now
have nothing to say in them. However, that&#8217;ll
not stop me from doing any little thing that I
think needs doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Campe put a trembling hand upon the big man&#8217;s
arm.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>&#8220;Bat,&#8221; said he, quietly enough, &#8220;no man was
ever more bedeviled than I am, and I&#8217;ve not been
exactly frank with you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Scanlon stopped him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some time we&#8217;ll both be in a humour for a
talk,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and we&#8217;ll save the matter till
then. Just now there is another bit of business to
work off. Get hold of it by the legs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Together they took up the heavy body and
carried it down the hall to Scanlon&#8217;s room, where
they laid it upon the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;He looks,&#8221; observed Bat, &#8220;as if he&#8217;d got his
last jolt; but he&#8217;ll live to get many more, so don&#8217;t
worry. What I want you to do, as a kind of
addition to your burden bearing, is to sit here and
watch him. Got your gun?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said young Campe.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he comes to, advise him to keep still; if he
refuses, poke the barrel in his face. If he insists,
hammer him over the head until he grows peaceful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Campe, &#8220;what are <i>you</i> going to
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look around a little,&#8221; replied Bat, who had
moved toward the door. &#8220;I&#8217;ll not be gone long.
Don&#8217;t say a word now, and watch your man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat softly opened the door and stepped out into
the hall. There was nothing definite in his mind;
but, vaguely, he felt that there were more
experiences to come.</p>

<p>&#8220;If one man came out of the vaults, why not
more?&#8221; he asked himself. &#8220;If some one opened
the door leading to those same vaults, how do I
know that he is not now opening another, leading
somewhere else?&#8221;</p>

<p>Quietly he slipped down the hall; the lights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
were only half up, and the recesses were dim; but
there was sufficient illumination for him to see
that no one was lurking in its length. Further
on the corridor took a sharp turn, and it was in
this angle that young Campe&#8217;s rooms were located.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better luck there, maybe,&#8221; breathed Bat, as
he stole along.</p>

<p>But, when he turned the corner, he found that
particular portion of the hall in darkness. Instantly
he realized that if any one were in hiding
there, he offered a fair mark; stepping quickly
back around the angle he turned out the nearest
lights, so that he was as much in the dark as the
possible prowler. Again he moved forward; but
he had not gone more than half-a-dozen steps
when he heard a slight sound ahead. He paused
and bent forward to listen. The sound continued,
creaking, rasping, complaining.</p>

<p>&#8220;A door,&#8221; thought Bat. &#8220;A door with unoiled
hinges&mdash;it&#8217;s being opened.&#8221;</p>

<p>His hand went to his hip, and once more the
thick automatic was out and ready. The sound
stopped; there was a silence for a time; then
began a rustling which was unmistakable&mdash;the
rustle of a woman&#8217;s skirt.</p>

<p>&#8220;The golden Helen!&#8221; was Scanlon&#8217;s next
thought. &#8220;And promptly on the job!&#8221;</p>

<p>The rustling stopped; then a whisper came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Paul!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no reply and again came the whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Paul!&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more came the creaking of hinges; another
door had opened.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; came the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush! Not so loud!&#8221; The whisper seemed
filled with fear.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>Then Bat heard the woman move further forward;
she spoke again, but this time so low that
he could not catch the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;The deuce,&#8221; said the man, startled. &#8220;How
do you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel sure of it,&#8221; was the whispered reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t lose your nerve,&#8221; said the man, swiftly.
&#8220;This is the first good chance we&#8217;ve had, and we
must make the best of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be careful,&#8221; pleaded the woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be sure to,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;And now
keep a lookout. If you hear or see anything, give
me the signal.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hinges of the invisible door creaked as it
closed; then the rustling of the skirts began once
more. As it approached Bat flattened himself
against the wall. Slowly the woman drew nearer;
then she was beside him, her skirts brushing him;
but that she was unaware of his presence was
proved by her continuing in silence and without a
pause. But after a few moments Bat heard a
slight sound as though she had caught her breath
suddenly, and she came to a halt.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s got to the turn in the hall,&#8221; said the big
man, mentally, &#8220;and she&#8217;s found the two lights off
duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the fact did not detain the woman, for once
more the rustling began and finally the listener
heard it die away.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now I may as well get on with my scouting,&#8221;
was Scanlon&#8217;s soundless resolution. &#8220;The
man inside there may be engaged in a matter
that would interest me a great deal.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he had barely got under way when he
halted.</p>

<p>&#8220;The skirts!&#8221; said he. &#8220;And coming back!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>Sure enough they were. <i>Frou-frou, frou-frou</i>,
they came, more sharply than before, for the
wearer was evidently moving at a brisker pace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something new!&#8221; said Scanlon. &#8220;Maybe
she&#8217;s dropped to my doings, and she&#8217;s going to
put the party in the room on to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He felt that he could not chance the passage
of the hall once more; his groping hand had
touched the wood of a door; now he found the
knob, opened the door silently as possible, slipped
inside and partially closed it. It was fortunate
that he did so; for immediately afterward came a
short, snapping sound, and a flare of light filled
the hall. Scanlon stooped cautiously to the key-hole,
and peered through it; there, holding a
lighted match above her golden head, stood Miss
Knowles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Came back looking for little me,&#8221; was Mr.
Scanlon&#8217;s conclusion. &#8220;Well, look away, Helen
of the crown of gold; for behind the door I&#8217;m
going to stick.&#8221;</p>

<p>The match burned out; there followed the
sound of some one moving along the hall, and
when silence had fallen once more, Scanlon began
to stir. But as he came from behind the door he
caught a trickle of light in the room. He stood
staring at it for a moment; and then it dawned
upon him what it was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still another door,&#8221; murmured he.</p>

<p>Gently he approached the light; it came, as he
judged, from under a door and through its key-hole.
He listened; from the adjoining room he
caught the sound of rustling paper, and now and
then the closing of a drawer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he the thorough little ransacker,
though?&#8221; continued Mr. Scanlon, immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
interpreting these sounds. &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s no use
in putting him to needless trouble; I&#8217;d better go
in and have a few words with him&mdash;if I can open
the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fortunately he found that he could; the door
swung in, and a man, who stood under a light
examining some papers at a table, lifted his head.
He put a handkerchief to his lips and coughed;
then he nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Mr. Scanlon was equally polite.</p>

<p>&#8220;I felt that I&#8217;d see you again,&#8221; stated he.
&#8220;But I had no idea it would be to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>The drawn-looking man turned over a few of
the papers; then gathered up the lot and threw
them into a drawer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unexpected little things have a way of happening,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;And it&#8217;s as well that they
do; for they are really of that elemental spice
which makes life worth while.&#8221; He dumped the
contents of another drawer upon the table, and
nodded toward a chair. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you sit down?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind if I do,&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon,
sociably.</p>

<p>And so he sat down in the chair. And while
the drawn man busied himself with the fresh
batch of papers, Bat took out the tobacco pouch
and the little packet of papers and rolled himself
a cigarette. This he lighted, and puffed away
comfortably.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to be hard at it,&#8221; commented he,
after a pause, during which he watched the labours
of the other.</p>

<p>The drawn man admitted that this was so by a
gesture.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s a more or less difficult proposition,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;This room is a regular dumping-place for
documents. They seem to have been snatched
up and brought here in barrels. Not the slightest
care has been taken to keep them properly
classed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut, tut!&#8221; observed Mr. Scanlon. &#8220;That&#8217;s
what I call just common carelessness. They
might have known that you&#8217;d call.&#8221;</p>

<p>The drawn man coughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;As to that,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure.
We&#8217;ve made an effort to avoid any extreme of
publicity, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite, quite!&#8221; remarked Bat, understandingly.
&#8220;Advertising&#8217;s a fine thing, but not in all
lines of endeavour.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other raked over the papers impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; said he, &#8220;we have an old will, a contract
for hauling stone, a marriage certificate, a
receipt from the Mexican government for the loan
of ten millions of dollars, an estimate for steel
rails, and a laundry bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s rather mixing them,&#8221; said Bat, framed
in cigarette smoke. &#8220;But keep at it; better
luck next time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Returning the papers to the drawer, the drawn
man next opened a heavy chest. He threw an
armful of documents upon the table, and plunged
into them with covetous hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would say that&#8217;s a promising lot, from its
general appearance,&#8221; commented Scanlon. &#8220;Of
course,&#8221; casually, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t the least idea what
you&#8217;re looking for, but here there seems to be a
holding to one thing, a kind of a tight, official,
important look, as it were.&#8221;</p>

<p>The covetous hands became eager; Bat noticed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
this; he threw down his cigarette; his muscles
tightened; the automatic thrilled in his grip.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you are short of ideas about what we
want,&#8221; spoke the other, still searching. &#8220;Has it
never occurred to you to ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Once or twice,&#8221; replied Scanlon. &#8220;But I
never got down to it. For instance, I met a
friend of yours downstairs a while ago&#8221;&mdash;here
the drawn man coughed, his eyes lifting for an
instant&mdash;&#8220;and I thought of putting the question
to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; asked the drawn man,
deep in the papers again.</p>

<p>&#8220;He hadn&#8217;t come to, up to the time I left,&#8221;
replied Bat. &#8220;I suppose I must have hit him
harder than I meant to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; said the drawn man, tolerantly,
&#8220;things of that sort <i>will</i> happen. They are
hardly to be avoided, in fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>He yawned and stretched his arms wide; the
light over his head smashed as he struck it and
went out. There came the rattle of the automatic,
and the splintering of window glass; the
dogs, always at large in the courtyard at night,
barked furiously. Bat heard the voice of Kretz
from the wall; the rifle sounded sharply, and
then silence, broken only by the sound of running
feet beyond the wall.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />


<small>SPEAKS OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THE GATES
OF SCHWARTZBERG WERE OPENED</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THROUGH the fragments of the window sash
and the shreds of the blind, Bat Scanlon
looked out upon the moonlit night. Directly
under the window was a roof, as near as he
could judge, that of the stable. Between this and
the top of the wall there was a space of some
twelve feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the fellow with the cough took it like a
broad jumper,&#8221; commented Bat. &#8220;Well, well, we
live and learn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then a light illuminated the room behind him;
he turned and met the wondering face of Miss
Knowles.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has happened?&#8221; she asked, rather
breathlessly.</p>

<p>Bat surveyed her with much composure. He
had been right in his estimate of her beauty; that
wasn&#8217;t to be denied. He was sure he&#8217;d never
seen a more splendid example of her type. Her
figure was like that of the queen in a story-book.
Her complexion was like snow and rose petals;
her eyes were as deep and as blue as the sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I hadn&#8217;t regular good reasons for believing
what I do, one look at her would scatter the whole
fleet of suspicion,&#8221; was Bat&#8217;s thought as he
gazed. &#8220;She does it well. I never saw a better
attempt at bluff. Ten minutes ago she was
talking to the crook; now here she is, asking as
innocently as you please: &#8216;What has happened?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard a noise as I sat in my room,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
Miss Knowles. &#8220;I heard shots,&#8221; her face a
trifle paler. &#8220;Has any one been hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No such luck,&#8221; replied Mr. Scanlon. He
replaced the automatic in his pocket and his
broad back against the wall. &#8220;Fellow was just
here making free with some papers. I chanced
to catch him, and he headed for the window.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl approached the table and looked at
the papers curiously; her hands wandered among
them and her eyes scanned one after another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he take any of them?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>A shock ran through the large frame of Mr.
Scanlon; for it occurred to him that he did not
know. He was busy wrestling with this somewhat
unpleasant thought when hasty feet were
heard tramping along the hall; and in another
moment Campe and the sergeant-major were in
the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was it?&#8221; asked Campe. &#8220;Did you see
him, Scanlon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; replied Bat. &#8220;And I let fly at him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then in as few words as possible he related his
experiences since leaving Campe on guard over
the unconscious prowler; he was careful, however,
to omit that part of it which dealt with the
whispering and the rustling of skirts in the hall-way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever his game is,&#8221; concluded the big
man, &#8220;he was a pal of the fellow you&#8217;ve got down
the hall.&#8221; Here he caught the expression that
came into Campe&#8217;s face; at the same instant he
noted that Miss Knowles had left the room. How
long she had been gone he did not know; but it
must have been while he was deep in his narrative.
&#8220;The man&#8217;s still there, ain&#8217;t he?&#8221; he
asked Campe.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I heard the shots I left the room,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
the young man. &#8220;Then Kretz ran upstairs, and
we came hunting you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without a word Bat rushed along the hall; the
door of his room was open, and the soft man was
gone. Then down the stairs went Bat, three at
a leap. The plug still held in the bolt of the cellar
door, so he was sure that the prowler had not
gone that way. There was only one other way
of escape. The gate! And when he reached the
courtyard the gate stood wide; the watch dogs
were running in and out, whining uncertainly and
apparently still much excited.</p>

<p>Both Campe and the German soldier had
pressed hard after Scanlon; and the young
master of Schwartzberg was aware of the truth as
soon as the big man.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone,&#8221; said he, in a husky kind of way.
&#8220;Gone!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if he&#8217;ll only stay gone, it&#8217;ll be all right,&#8221;
spoke Mr. Scanlon. &#8220;And while we&#8217;re thinking
over the possibilities of that,&#8221; to Kretz, &#8220;suppose
you shut the gate.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant-major did as requested; at the
order of young Campe, he mounted guard upon
the wall once more, and then both Campe and
Scanlon made a complete search of the castle;
every nook and crevice was examined, but
evidently if there had been others they had also
taken occasion to depart with the opening of
the portal.</p>

<p>&#8220;The gentlemen who are in the habit of visiting
you,&#8221; remarked Mr. Scanlon to the master of
Schwartzberg, &#8220;are very self-possessed, and have
more than the usual share of grey matter. I
never saw any one collection of persons with more
up their sleeves than this lot appears to have.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>&#8220;They are cunning enough,&#8221; said the other;
and there was a hopeless note in his voice. &#8220;Sufficiently
so to get the better of me, at all events.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a fight like this,&#8221; advised Mr. Scanlon,
&#8220;never admit, even to yourself, that the opposition
is on top of you. It has a bad effect. Even the
best of us has no real liking for a bruising battle,
if we get the bruising; and we&#8217;re only looking
for an excuse to side step. And thoughts like
those provide the excuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the cellar door Campe stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll not venture into the vaults,&#8221; said he, in
a tired way. His face had the sagged look which
hopelessness brings, and his eyes were dull and
weary. &#8220;It may not be safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s clear enough to me,&#8221; said Scanlon,
bluntly, &#8220;that some one has pretty plain sailing
into these cellars of yours. They seem to come
piling in whenever the spirit moves them. I&#8217;d
do something in the matter if I were you, even if
it was only to post a warning to trespassers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be a way of getting in,&#8221; admitted
Campe, dully. &#8220;I made up my mind to that
some time ago. But,&#8221; and his voice broke into
a sharpness that startled Scanlon, &#8220;a man whose
life is in danger every moment of it can&#8217;t take
too many chances.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat put his hands on the young man&#8217;s shoulders
and looked steadily into his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold up!&#8221; said he, &#8220;Hold up! You&#8217;re up
against something raw and hard. But don&#8217;t let
them stop you. No matter what the thing is&mdash;sit
tight. You&#8217;re going to win out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Win!&#8221; Campe threw up his hands and
laughed mirthlessly. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know the facts
or you wouldn&#8217;t say that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;m not on to <i>all</i> the facts,&#8221; said Bat,
stuffing his hands into his pockets, &#8220;but I&#8217;m on
to the very worst of the lot. And even in spite
of that, I say you&#8217;ll win.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The worst!&#8221; said Campe, and his eyes
searched Bat&#8217;s face. &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean just that&mdash;the worst! Listen. One
time when I was a youngster I was out with old
Dick Bunder, packing stuff out to Gabriel City.
Now Gabriel was out on the desert and was made
up of a half dozen houses and a few tents around
a water-hole. The first night I spent in the
place it was attacked by Apaches, and the thing
went on for days. Bitter, cruel work it was in
the heat, with no sleep, and death barking always
from across the sands. The Apaches were bad,
but,&#8221; and Bat shook his head, &#8220;there was something
worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; said young Campe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Much worse,&#8221; affirmed Bat. &#8220;And it was
inside. Somebody was calling off our hands to
the enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Campe&#8217;s face grew rigid; his mouth twitched
and one shaking hand went to it as though to
hide his weakness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some one inside,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Inside! Yes,
that&#8217;s a fearful thing. Outside&#8217;s bad enough.
But the other.&#8221; He stood, his fingers pressing
against his lips for a moment; then he asked,
suddenly, &#8220;Did you find the person out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; answered the big man. &#8220;And I
have found out the one in Schwartzberg.&#8221;</p>

<p>Campe stretched out the shaking hand and laid
it against Scanlon&#8217;s chest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say anything more,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Not
her name, for God&#8217;s sake! I couldn&#8217;t stand that!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />


<small>DEALS WITH SOME HAPPENINGS OF THE NEXT DAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE remainder of the night passed without
incident; and next morning, Scanlon
accompanied by Kretz, who carried the
light, made a complete tour of the regions beneath
the castle. No one was hidden there; there were
only the massive walls and arches, the damp
and the echo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Locks and bolts seem to offer no hindrance
to housebreakers,&#8221; said Bat, speaking to Campe
who met them when they came up. &#8220;So, with
your permission, we&#8217;ll have a few additional
precautions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Procuring a hammer and some heavy nails, the
door to the vaults was made fast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; Bat proceeded, &#8220;we are in a position
to offer some defence against another invasion.
But,&#8221; and he glanced from Campe to the silent
German, and back again, &#8220;how the dickens they
got into the cellar puzzles me. I looked all
around; but not a way could I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we can prevent any further entrances into
the house itself, for the present, we&#8217;ll be satisfied,&#8221;
said Campe.</p>

<p>Scanlon did not approve of this. It indicated
a willingness to share something with the enemy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which is always wrong,&#8221; he told himself,
later, as he trudged along the road on his way to
Marlowe Furnace. &#8220;If it was my affair, I&#8217;d
shake it up till I had those crooks headed for the
next county.&#8221;</p>

<p>Campe had abruptly closed the conversation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
the night before with the request that no names
be mentioned, and so Scanlon had been left in a
state of doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;He knows, or suspects about the girl,&#8221;
thought the big man, &#8220;but what about these
other people? Has he got them placed? I&#8217;d
&#8217;a told him all I&#8217;d seen and heard last night,
but as he wanted silence, silence it is. Anyway,&#8221;
as an afterthought, &#8220;it might have been a wrong
move to say anything more than I did. Maybe
Ashton-Kirk doesn&#8217;t want him told.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were no letters for him at the village
post-office, and he was much disappointed. So
much had happened to him in the last twenty-four
hours that he had the feeling that Ashton-Kirk
must also have had some exciting experiences
which he would report at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he hasn&#8217;t had time to say anything,&#8221;
reasoned the big man. &#8220;Maybe I&#8217;ll get something
in the mail to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood upon the post-office steps and lighted
a cigar; while he was puffing thoughtfully at this,
he felt his arm jostled gently. Turning he saw
an old man with a basket on his arm, and a hand
tangled in a chin beard.</p>

<p>&#8220;How d&#8217;ye do?&#8221; asked the old man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty fair,&#8221; said Bat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stopping up at Schwartzberg, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thought so. My name&#8217;s Henry; got a
brother over at the station.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Bat. &#8220;I detect the family
resemblance. How is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doing tolerable.&#8221; There was a slight pause,
then the old man disentangled the hand and
jostled Scanlon&#8217;s arm once more. &#8220;Remember a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
man that asked for you one night at the station&mdash;fat
kind of a fellow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Bat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Saw him last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That so?&#8221; Bat was unmoved, smoking
calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helped to take him to Doc. Sharpless&#8217;s.
Found him in the road, not far from Schwartzberg.
Was coming along in a waggon with my
brother when I seen him. Only for the moon
we&#8217;d run over him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was wrong?&#8221; asked Scanlon, carelessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know. He told Doc. Sharpless he fell
somehow. Doc. says he&#8217;d got a bad bump.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old fellow looked at Bat as though he
expected him to say something. But the big man
examined the wrapper of his cigar in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d never knowed who the fellow was,&#8221; said
the man with the basket, &#8220;only my brother was
along. He told me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still Bat was silent, and the greater grew the
old chap&#8217;s disappointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;We reckoned you&#8217;d like to hear about him,&#8221;
resumed he. &#8220;Of course we thought he must be
a friend of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Entire stranger,&#8221; replied Bat, briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Funny, aint it, how he should come asking
after you like that, and you not know him? And
then to find him unconscious in the road out by
the castle, too. We thought that was very
queer.&#8221;</p>

<p>It occurred to Scanlon that the tone of the old
man&#8217;s remarks was not desirable. So he
attempted to shift it about.</p>

<p>&#8220;When a person feels that he must fall,&#8221;
remarked Bat, &#8220;he should be very careful in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
selection of a place to fall in. Now the middle of
a roadway as a site shows carelessness don&#8217;t you
think?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the ancient refused to be side-tracked. He
clung to his theme like a terrier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we thought it was kind of queer,&#8221; he
re-affirmed. &#8220;But then,&#8221; with a shake of his
head, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know as we should, after all. For
there&#8217;s such a lot of queer things going on around
Schwartzberg that we shouldn&#8217;t be surprised at
one more. What between some kind of thunder,
and gun shots and people running and racing
about in the night, that house has given this
village something to think about.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat grinned, and smoked away.</p>

<p>&#8220;So they think the castle&#8217;s a place of interest,
do they?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a place they&#8217;re afraid of,&#8221; said the old
man. Since he had failed to get Scanlon to talk,
he seemed determined to do the next best thing&mdash;talk
himself. &#8220;Tom Gould&#8217;s constable here, and
he&#8217;s thinking of looking into things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; said Bat, &#8220;we can&#8217;t blame Tom for
showing a little enterprise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t never been any such goings on at
Marlowe Furnace before,&#8221; stated the man with
the basket. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t think folks&#8217;ll put up
with it much longer. Shots and strange noises
and finding people hurt in the middle of the
road&#8217;ll never do. It ought to be seen into.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you speak to Campe?&#8221; suggested
Bat.</p>

<p>&#8220;How could I&mdash;or anybody else, if it comes to
that?&#8221; demanded the ancient. &#8220;How often is
he seen? And when he does come out, why does
he look as if he was running away when he gits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
sight of anybody? What&#8217;s wrong with him?
What&#8217;s he afraid of? What&#8217;s he done&mdash;him with
his dogs, and his man on the wall, and his searchlight,
frightening the women and kids?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Bat, &#8220;you&#8217;re imagining a good
deal of this. Anyway, it&#8217;s Campe&#8217;s own place,
and I suppose he can do as he likes on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded to the old man with a smile, but
as he walked away from the post-office he was
thoughtful enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Getting on the nerves of the population, eh?&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t wonder. A fellow can&#8217;t
go slam-hanging around like that and not attract
attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>He noticed, as he went along, that more than
one person regarded him curiously; little knots
of people gathered behind him, their heads together
and no doubt deep in the discussion of the
odd doings about Schwartzberg. He had left
Marlowe Furnace some distance behind when an
idea occurred to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll just top a few of these hills to the left,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;and stop off at the inn. It wouldn&#8217;t
surprise me if I saw or heard some little thing of
interest. These fellows with the lame lungs and
the lame legs seem to have more to them than a
first glance shows.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Mr. Scanlon confidently took the path across
the hills. As a rule a criminal caught in the
act of housebreaking would not be expected to
linger in the neighbourhood of his exploit; but
that the man with the cough had departed was
not at all in the calculations of Bat.</p>

<p>&#8220;According to the dope of both Kirk and Mrs.
Kretz, Campe is afraid of the police,&#8221; was the way
the big man reasoned it out. &#8220;Knowing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
nature of the thing which makes Campe afraid,
the housebreaker knows that the police won&#8217;t be
called in. So, then, he&#8217;ll stick around, waiting
for another chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the road which led to the inn Bat heard the
sound of wheels; it was the rolling chair containing
the man with the flattened skull. The black,
glittering eyes of the invalid fixed themselves upon
Bat as he came up with the chair. The big man
noted this and nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nice day,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Splendid,&#8221; replied the invalid, in his peculiarly
strong voice. &#8220;In fact there has been a succession
of fine days. This district seems specially
favoured.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat nodded his head many times.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking something like that
myself,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There seem to be things here
which a fellow wouldn&#8217;t be likely to run into
anywhere else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed you a number of times with your
dogs and gun,&#8221; said the sick man. &#8220;The game
is none too plentiful hereabouts, I should
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It depends a good bit on what you&#8217;re after,&#8221;
stated Mr. Scanlon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose that is true.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tone of the man in the chair was quieter
than usual; his manner, too seemed mild. But
the expression of his full-lipped mouth was one of
infinite savagery; his eyes shone like those of a
caged beast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor sent you out here, I suppose,&#8221; said
Scanlon, as they went on toward the inn.</p>

<p>The invalid gestured with one wasted hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;We who have no health,&#8221; said he, &#8220;are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
for ever under a doctor&#8217;s directions. We can
never follow our own desires.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat regarded the speaker attentively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any one,&#8221; was his thought, &#8220;who could make
you do what you didn&#8217;t want to do would be a
good one.&#8221;</p>

<p>But aloud he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;So I fancy! The doc. who has you in charge,
I&#8217;ve noticed, seems to have some confidence in
fresh air. I suppose that&#8217;s why you keep so
much to the roads?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the invalid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Outdoors,&#8221; said Scanlon, &#8220;is a fine thing. I
guess that&#8217;s why there is so much of it. It&#8217;s full
of benefits, night and day. Moonlight nights,&#8221;
sagely, &#8220;are especially good. Then you not only
get the air, but you get a view of things, which
helps the mind. Last night was as bright as
day, and Schwartzberg looks well with the moon
on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The beast in the man glared out more than ever
from the black eyes, and the teeth gleamed
between the full lips. But he said, quietly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes; I can believe that Schwartzberg is
an interesting place. I have given it some attention
since I have been here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;A number of people have,&#8221; said he. &#8220;We
have visitors dropping in every now and then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some time <i>I</i> shall go,&#8221; said the invalid. &#8220;I
have been promising myself that for a long while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite,&#8221; said the big man, easily; &#8220;of course.
But the others only stayed a little while. When
you come, we&#8217;ll keep you longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said the sick man. &#8220;You are
very kind.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>Here his chair turned into the gravel path leading
to the inn door, and Scanlon followed it. The
cramped-looking man with the crutch and the
walking stick was stamping up and down.</p>

<p>&#8220;The blood,&#8221; declared the cramped-looking
man, &#8220;is the most important thing in the body.
It is meant to carry vigour to all our outlying
parts; but, sir, it carries other things at times&mdash;other
things not so desirable.&#8221;</p>

<p>A tall man with a saffron complexion and a
pair of thick blue spectacles sat in a cane chair;
his clothes hung about him as if he had shrunken
a half-hundredweight in a short time; his long
hands, as yellow as his face, were clasped before
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not try to belittle the function of the
blood,&#8221; said he in a husky voice. &#8220;It would be
foolish in me to do so. But you exaggerate it,
sir. And why? Your joints are solidifying
through deposits of lime; this is carried to the
joints by the blood, and therefore you give undue
importance to that fluid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Undue importance!&#8221; The cramped man
paused in his stumping and seemed astounded.
&#8220;Undue! But, my good sir, how can that be?
It is life itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The yellow-faced man jeered at this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fiddlesticks!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Fiddlesticks, Mr.
Hirst. Since the time Harvey discovered its circulation,
sentimentalists have overpraised this
corpuscle-carrying agent. They have given it
credit which it in no way deserves. In much
the same way poets and novelists have misrepresented
the heart. To them, this is the seat
of affection&mdash;of every noble impulse&mdash;where, as a
matter of fact, it is nothing more than a pump.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>The cramped-looking man cast a look of complaint
at every one on the porch; then he was
about to put it into words, but the yellow man
stopped him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You spoke of the blood as &#8216;carrying vigour,&#8217;&#8221;
said the latter. &#8220;&#8216;Carrying,&#8217; mind you. And
that&#8217;s all it does&mdash;carry. It remains for other
and more important things to make and introduce
both that vigour of which you speak and that lack
of vigour. The liver, now; take that! There&#8217;s a
piece of machinery for you. There&#8217;s an organ
which means something.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cramped man seemed amused. He cackled
and hammered with his cane upon the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;The liver,&#8221; said he; &#8220;why, I&#8217;ve known men
to go on forty years who had no livers at all.
Because yours has refused to secrete and has
painted you up with jaundice, you put it in front,
and belittle more important things. With good
blood, sir, a man need have no liver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Without a liver,&#8221; maintained the saffron-hued
man, &#8220;he could not have good blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Scanlon nodded to the landlord.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fine, uplifting conversation,&#8221; said he, in
a low tone. &#8220;Do you have to listen to them
often?&#8221;</p>

<p>The innkeeper smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;About two-thirds of the talk here is of
symptoms,&#8221; answered he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I once stopped at a hotel in Colorado,&#8221; said
Bat, &#8220;where they were loaded up with a gang
something like this one of yours. They&#8217;d sit
around and draw diagrams of each other, and
stick pins in the places where their ailments were
located. And I never saw one of them back
out when it came to the possession of the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
deadly complaint. They were as keen for the
championship as a crowd of golfers round a green.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These are about like that,&#8221; said the landlord.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s funny the way the thing works,&#8221; commented
Bat. &#8220;A man can go along all his life
with no one paying the slightest attention to him;
then he accumulates a rare disease, and at once
becomes an object of interest. Can you blame
him if he cherishes his aches and makes much of
his pains? They&#8217;ve lifted him out of the rut for
the first time in his life, and given him something
to brag about.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wheels of the rolling chair sounded upon
the porch floor, and the squat servant pushed it out
into the hotel. Scanlon glanced about.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see the man with the cough,&#8221; said he
to the landlord.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Shaw, I suppose you mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sort of a worn-out looking fellow,&#8221; said Bat,
carelessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Shaw met with a small but rather painful
accident,&#8221; said the landlord. &#8220;It happened last
night; he scratched and bruised himself by falling
into one of my hot-bed glasses, which some one
left carelessly in the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Bat. &#8220;Glass hurt much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About all broken,&#8221; said the innkeeper laconically.
&#8220;But I can&#8217;t understand who could have
been touching it, and why.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Scanlon felt that he could enlighten the
hotel man upon both these points, but he judged
it best to keep the matter to himself. Here the
man with the crutch stumped away into the hotel,
and in a few moments the landlord followed.
The saffron-hued man turned his dark glasses upon Scanlon.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but I had not
noticed you before. Are you a guest of the
house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Bat. &#8220;Not yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was recommended here,&#8221; said the man.
&#8220;Just came yesterday. I find that most of the
guests are here for a purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So <i>I&#8217;ve</i> noticed,&#8221; replied Scanlon, agreeably.</p>

<p>The jaundiced man shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, the doctors,&#8221; said he. &#8220;If I could control
my liver without their attention, I&#8217;d be
satisfied never to lay eyes upon another one of
them.&#8221; He studied Bat for a space, and then said
in an awed tone, &#8220;The liver, sir, is a most
tremendous thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I&#8217;ve heard,&#8221; said Scanlon, cheerfully. &#8220;I
suppose I&#8217;ve got one myself, but it&#8217;s never introduced
itself to me, and so I haven&#8217;t given it much
attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>The saffron-hued man seemed appalled at this
last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I am a stranger, and I know
it is a very great liberty to take, but I cannot help
a word to you, now that I see it is needed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Bat, &#8220;go ahead!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some one&mdash;and a very wise person it must
have been&mdash;has said: &#8216;In time of peace, prepare
for war.&#8217; That, sir, should be the duty of every
man; he should not procrastinate; he should, so
to speak, take his liver by the forelock, and tame
it&mdash;tame it, sir, completely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; protested Mr. Scanlon, &#8220;a liver that&#8217;s
never, in its career as such, said anything to its
owner, seems to me to be tame enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>The jaundiced one grew more agitated than
ever.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be deceived,&#8221; begged he. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be
imposed upon. They are things given to the
most deplorable treachery. One can place no
faith in them whatever; they are worthy of not
the lightest confidence. They have been known,&#8221;
and here his voice shook a little, &#8220;to stop short in
their functions at an instant&#8217;s notice&mdash;and this
after years of apparent devotion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Scanlon, &#8220;that does sound like a
dirty trick, that&#8217;s a fact. But what&#8217;s a fellow
unaccustomed to such things to do? How is he
to know when to jump in with his corrective
measures?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any time will do before the thing asserts its
independence of you. If it is mild, beware of it;
for like as not it will eventually become like an
old man of the sea and rule you completely.
Scourge it; drench it with compelling draughts;
submerge it completely; bombard it with bitter
pills.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; said Bat, &#8220;you speak as a man
who neglected all these measures.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Utterly, sir, utterly!&#8221; The saffron-hued
man shook his head sadly. &#8220;I had no voice to
speak a warning word; I was unlearned in the
wiles of the thing. Even after it had secured the
whip hand of me, I could have defeated it if I had
been told how by a person of experience in such
struggles. With a few dozen bottles of &#8216;Seaweed
Tonic&#8217; I could have stopped its assaults; and with
a handful of &#8216;Grady&#8217;s Grey Granules&#8217; I could
have put it to flight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon, &#8220;I&#8217;ll lay in a stock
of those some time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are the only permanent hope of man,&#8221;
declared the yellow gentleman. &#8220;Behind a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
stockade made of the &#8216;Tonic&#8217; and the &#8216;Granules&#8217;
he can defy the encroachments of even the most
evilly disposed of livers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat went inside, smoked a second cigar, and
chatted with the landlord. None of the guests
was to be seen, and so the big man gradually
drifted into a conversation concerning them.
But the landlord was apparently without any
information.</p>

<p>&#8220;They come and they go,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and, as I
said, I&#8217;m glad to have them, to get over the
autumn and the winter months. But I don&#8217;t
know anything about them except that they are
sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a time Scanlon, seeing that little was to
be gained by lingering about the inn, departed.
He noted that the jaundiced man was not upon
the porch as he crossed it; but beyond that he
never gave him a thought.</p>

<p>However, when he saw him, small and far away
on a hilltop, stooping, studying and moving here
and there, the big man manifested some interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said he; &#8220;what&#8217;s this?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cautiously he made his way toward the spot,
moving along fences and keeping trees between
himself and the other where it was possible.
Finally he was able to make out the man and his
doings with little difficulty.</p>

<p>The saffron-coloured one had a glass in his hand
and was examining the hole of an oak tree which
grew on the crest of the hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Same tree I stood under last night when
I watched the fellow in the rolling chair,&#8221; murmured
Bat. &#8220;Wonder what he finds wrong with
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>From the tree the yellow man fell to carefully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
noting the dried stems of some stunted bushes;
then he studied something here and there upon
the ground, sometimes using the glass, but more
often not.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I didn&#8217;t have a first-class reason for suspecting
invalids,&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon, &#8220;I&#8217;d say this
fellow was a botanist&mdash;maybe hunting a plant
which, when cooked, would have some sort of a
discouraging effect on the liver.&#8221;</p>

<p>He watched the man for some time; carefully
the saffron-hued one went from place to place,
from tree to tree, from one clump of dried brush
to another. Gradually he moved down one hill
and up the side of another. From the top of this
a good view was to be had of Schwartzberg
through the trees, and stationing himself behind
one of these, the stranger looked long and searchingly
toward the castle.</p>

<p>Kretz was not to be seen upon the walls; but
at one of the windows Bat made out a woman&#8217;s
figure. Apparently the saffron-hued man also
saw her; but apparently he desired a better view.
So taking a field-glass from a case which hung at
his side, he trained it upon the window.</p>

<p>He spent some little time in watching the
woman; then putting the glass away he moved
along a road that ran between the hills at a sharp
angle from Schwartzberg. Much interested, Bat
followed. Again the stranger turned sharply, this
time toward the river. And now Scanlon understood
his movements.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been making for the waterside all along,&#8221;
reasoned the big man. &#8220;And he came this way
so as not to be seen from the castle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Evidently this was correct. The stranger, when
he gained the river, began walking along its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
margin in the direction of Schwartzberg, concealed
by a sharp rise in the ground. But his
searching glances seemed not to gain him the
satisfaction he sought; and so, finally, though
he did not seem at all eager to do so, he
approached that portion of the riverside in full
view of the castle.</p>

<p>The river was fairly broad at this point, and its
placid waters flowed by with scarcely a ripple; a
great mass of soft reddish rocks ran from the
walls of the castle down to the water&#8217;s edge.</p>

<p>&#8220;He seems somewhat backward about putting
himself on display,&#8221; said Scanlon, as he watched
the doings of the jaundiced man with keen attention.
&#8220;But, then, he may have the most urgent
reasons for it, so I&#8217;ll not pick on him for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>From across the river came the sounds of
laughing; some boys were fishing from a boat,
and were shouting to each other over some comic
misadventure. The saffron-hued man lifted his
head and looked out across the slowly flowing
water; but the pause was for an instant only; for
he proceeded with the matter in hand.</p>

<p>A dozen yards further on he stooped, and
seemed to grow intent and eager. Out came the
lens which Bat had seen him use on the top of
the tall hill, and down on his knees he went to
examine something on the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;And right there,&#8221; said Bat, &#8220;is the place
where the soft-looking party broke through the
edge of the bank and flopped into the water.&#8221; He
stood watching for a space, and then, unable to
restrain his curiosity, he pulled his hat firmly
down upon his head and said: &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll have a
closer view of those proceedings. They may
contain something I ought to know.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>With a light step he moved along the river
bank until he was within a half dozen paces of
the stooping yellow man. Then he paused, and
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! What&#8217;s the idea? Lost something?&#8221;</p>

<p>The yellow man replied promptly, without
turning or lifting his head, and in a voice from
which every vestige of huskiness was gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just working out a little idea, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the voice Mr. Scanlon gasped. Then the
man&#8217;s head lifted without the blue glasses. Even
the yellow stain was no disguise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kirk!&#8221; said the big man. &#8220;Kirk, by
George!&#8221;</p>

<small>IN WHICH ASHTON-KIRK HEARS MATTERS OF
INTEREST</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE special detective smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a moment,&#8221; said he; &#8220;there are a
few little indications which I want to make
sure of, then I&#8217;ll talk to you.&#8221; Swiftly he worked
with the glass and a small ivory rule; then pocketing
these he resumed the blue glasses and arose
to his feet. &#8220;I gather from your words and your
expression of face that you&#8217;re a trifle surprised!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a clean knock-out,&#8221; announced Bat. He
looked closely at the other and then shook his
head. &#8220;I never understood before how much a
man&#8217;s eyes had to do with his appearance,&#8221; said
he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hide the eyes,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk, &#8220;and you
are half disguised already. Then a change in the
voice and the dress and you are complete, only
needing some acting along the line of your
assumed character. The r&ocirc;le of a sick man is one
of the easiest to assume, as perhaps any physician
could tell you. The blue glasses are natural,
then; also the tinted skin and the huskiness of
voice. A suit of clothes three or four sizes too
large at once sets you down as having lost a great
deal of weight; and then some intimate conversation
regarding your particular complaint places
you above suspicion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Intimate conversation is good,&#8221; said Mr.
Scanlon. &#8220;You talked about yours with the
freedom and knowledge of a man who had bred
one for years. But without that I&#8217;d not have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
recognized you; you fitted so well into place
among that outfit of crooks that I never thought
of you being something else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Crooks!&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk. &#8220;So you have
found that out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I should say yes. Since I&#8217;ve come here
I&#8217;ve found out two things at least; and they are
that a man might be rolled in a chair and still be
a fairly competent criminal; and also that a man
might cough and cough, and be a villain still.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you might go further than Alva and
Shaw,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk, &#8220;and still be fairly
safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean the man with the crutch?&#8221;</p>

<p>The crime specialist nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Also the landlord,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Bat whistled at this and stared. The other
went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;On our first visit there I fancied I caught a
certain undertone of insincerity; an indefinite air
of pre-arrangement pervaded the place; there
were moments when I had the feeling that a sort
of stage play had been arranged for our benefit.
This, with some other things, made me somewhat
curious, and yesterday I made a few queries at a
small hotel some miles away. As I expected, the
proprietor was perfectly willing to talk. He told
me, as you did, that the innkeeper over yonder
had only had the place for about six months, and
that his present guests came at practically the
same time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Other guests had gone there from time to
time, but things were very unpleasant, and as no
attempt was made to put them right, the newcomers
had never remained long.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>&#8220;The unpleasantness was made to order, eh?&#8221;
observed Bat. &#8220;The new guests were not
wanted.&#8221; He looked at the detective for a
moment, then he added: &#8220;That house is headquarters
for the whole movement against Campe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have taken the liberty of learning the size
and peculiarities of the footprints made by the
various gentlemen holding forth there, and I find
they correspond exactly with those of persons
whose movements hereabouts show an intense
interest in Schwartzberg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Bat, &#8220;I see there are various ways
of coming at a fact. You began with a mental
impression and ended with the impression of a
foot; and I started with the expression of a lady&#8217;s
face, and finished with an expression of amazement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve also been having some experiences
then,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk, interest in his voice. &#8220;I
rather fancied you would. And as there will be
no better time than the present, suppose you tell
me just what they were.&#8221;</p>

<p>They seated themselves upon a flat rock out of
eyeshot of Schwartzberg, and Bat began a report
of his adventures. He told of his meeting with
Miss Knowles on the road and her agitation at the
thought of a fresh visit from the crime specialist;
of the soft-looking man who stood in the lane
writing in a leather-covered book; of Miss
Knowles and her interest in the direction of the
wind; of his seeing her at the window overlooking
that point afterward; of the man in the chair and
his strange actions; of the meeting with the man
with the cough and the peppery little doctor; of
the happening on the river bank; of his talk with
Mrs. Kretz; of the laying low of the soft man; of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
the whispered conversation between the housebreaker
and the woman in the darkened hall; of
the escape of the latter; of the disappearance of
Miss Knowles from the room, followed by the
liberation of the prisoner.</p>

<p>When Bat had finished&mdash;and he did not slight
a detail&mdash;his friend laughed softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Experiences&mdash;yes,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And you have
a most excellent memory. When you came to
me the other day you complained of everything
being elusive and difficult to make head or tail of.
It would seem, from what you have told me now,
that this had changed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Altogether,&#8221; said Scanlon. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know a
great deal more of the truth, but there&#8217;s no end to
the happenings. As a matter of fact, I seem to
be squaring up to something all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And something of undoubted interest,&#8221; said
Ashton-Kirk. He looked toward the river and
added, &#8220;That, I suppose, is the place where
you heard the man tumble into the water last
night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Bat; &#8220;there where the bank
is broken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll remember that,&#8221; said the other. &#8220;Indeed,
it was in the hope of coming upon something
of the sort that I came this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat looked at him in surprise, but before he
could speak the other went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;The matter of the northwest wind has a rare
sound, and the affair of the sword will in the end,
I have no doubt, prove of much interest.&#8221; He
was silent for a space as though thinking, and
then proceeded: &#8220;And so Mrs. Kretz is inclined
to suspect the girl of foul work?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat nodded.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>&#8220;She is,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And, much against my
will, I&#8217;m inclined to do the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You say you heard her talk to Shaw in the
dark hall; and afterwards when she had suspected
something wrong because of the lights further
along being turned off, she came back to learn
who had done it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She did,&#8221; said Bat. &#8220;I saw her as plainly as
I see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Things fall together very oddly at times,&#8221;
said the crime specialist, more to himself than to
Bat. &#8220;Very oddly.&#8221; Then to Scanlon: &#8220;Miss
Knowles, you say, was interested to know if Shaw
had taken any of the papers at which he was
looking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Bat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I, also, am a trifle curious as to that.&#8221; The
soulless blue glasses were fixed upon the big man
steadily. &#8220;What did Campe have to say in the
matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; replied Bat. &#8220;At least nothing
that I heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s curious,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk, &#8220;how a man
will hold to silence regarding some things. In the
midst of happenings which sap his courage and
weaken his will in everything else, this young
man keeps his mouth shut as to the cause of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s something which began with his father,&#8221;
said Bat, &#8220;and you think it might be, as your
sending your man to Mexico shows&mdash;isn&#8217;t it
possible that Campe doesn&#8217;t know what it is?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the crime specialist shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he. &#8220;If this were so, he would
not hesitate to call in the police.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; said Bat. &#8220;It never occurred
to me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>&#8220;Your crippled man, in his chair on the hilltop,
watching the moon on the towers of Schwartzberg,
is a pleasing thought,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk.
The keen, complete form which he gave every
word showed intense interest. &#8220;He smiled, you
say, and closed his eyes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And a couple of times he laughed,&#8221; answered
Scanlon.</p>

<p>&#8220;The hill is northwest of the castle, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Almost exactly, as far as I can make out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Miss Knowles stood in a window facing
in that direction?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little while before she had expressed, by
certain mannerisms, an odd sort of interest in that
particular point of the compass?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was plain enough,&#8221; stated Bat. &#8220;Anybody
who was there could see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks,&#8221; and again the vacant blue glasses
fixed themselves upon Mr. Scanlon, &#8220;it looks
quite a bit like something pre-arranged. A signal,
perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Scanlon shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he. &#8220;The hill is too far away.
And another thing: moonlight, no matter how
bright, is uncertain. You can&#8217;t be dead sure of
getting an eye full of anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk nodded; the blue glasses looked
rounder and more vacant than before. But there
was a deep wrinkle at the top of the nose between
them which told Scanlon that the detective had
marked the incident well.</p>

<p>&#8220;It means something,&#8221; the big man told himself.
&#8220;And he&#8217;ll hit on it before he&#8217;s through.
But <i>what</i> it means and how he&#8217;s going to work on
it is too much for me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>After a little Ashton-Kirk arose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay here,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I&#8217;ll not be more than a
few minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he was gone a good half hour, and in that
time Bat could see him prowling up and down
along the river bank, the blue glasses off and the
magnifying lens in his hands. The rocks in
particular seemed to interest him; and when
he returned he carried a bit of one in his
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Soft, and almost crying its age aloud,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;I know of no region of such little interest
to a geologist.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood for a space, the long yellow fingers
crumbling the surface of the soft stone; then he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The recent activity around here seems to
prove one thing to me; and that is that Campe&#8217;s
enemies have made up their minds to end
what might very well be called the siege of
Schwartzberg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon. &#8220;They are
pushing the job to its finish. And I can tell you
why. The girl has tipped them off that you are
here, and has handed them your record. They
mean to rush the fight from now on, afraid that
you&#8217;re coming back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you are not quite sure as to the people
inside the castle,&#8221; said the detective, &#8220;I will
recommend that you keep even a keener watch
than before. But do so in such a way as not to
attract attention. Especially watch for small
events; they are more apt to be of value to us
than showier ones; people as a rule are guarded
as to the big things, while the small ones are
gone through often with no care.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>&#8220;When do you hope to hear from Fuller?&#8221;
asked Scanlon.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will take the greater part of a week for him
to reach the place of operation, and with the best
of luck two days will be taken up in gathering the
facts I want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A lot of things may happen in that time,&#8221;
remarked the big man. &#8220;It might be that before
you get his report we&#8217;ll meet the rush of the
invalid corps in such a way that we&#8217;ll put them
down for the count.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk made no reply; the big man
waited for a moment or two; the vacant blue
glasses were fixed upon a point some little distance
away. Scanlon turned and looked in the same
direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said he, in a low tone. &#8220;Who&#8217;s
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>A man walked along the river bank, his head
bent, his eyes upon the ground. But as the two
looked the head lifted and he saw them. He
started and stiffened suddenly. Then his hand
went up in a salute, and he moved toward them.</p>

<p>It was the German sergeant-major, Kretz.</p>

<small>TELLS HOW AMAZEMENT FILLED THE MIND OF
MR. SCANLON</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE was something in the manner of
Kretz as he approached that drew Bat
Scanlon&#8217;s attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say that he was somewhat peevish,&#8221;
said the big man to Ashton-Kirk. &#8220;But why I
can&#8217;t say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed, the face of the German was grimmer
than ever; his small grey eyes looked from under
their thick, overhanging brows in a way that
showed open hostility.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said Scanlon. &#8220;Having a little
exercise?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the man ignored this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is this?&#8221; asked he, and his angry eyes
were fixed upon Ashton-Kirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;A friend of mine,&#8221; replied Bat. &#8220;He&#8217;s stopping
over at the inn. Only had the pleasure of
meeting him this morning, but I will say for him
that he has one of the most picturesque livers in
captivity.&#8221;</p>

<p>The German only looked grim.</p>

<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is private property.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Flood,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk,
huskily. &#8220;And I am sorry to trespass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you reach the edge of our domain in
going back, be sure to wipe your shoes,&#8221; admonished
Scanlon. &#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t care to have you
take any of it away with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man with a yellow face smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, good-day, Mr. Scanlon,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
think I&#8217;ll make my way back to the inn. You
have been very kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said Bat, with a wave of the
hand. &#8220;Glad to do any little thing I can for you
at any time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fictitious Mr. Flood, saffron-hued, blue-spectacled
and stiff-gaited, moved away, taking a
path which soon hid him from view behind the
rising ground.</p>

<p>Kretz now turned to Scanlon.</p>

<p>&#8220;You,&#8221; said he, &#8220;are a friend of Mr. Campe&#8217;s.
Good! I am but a servant. Good! It is not
my place to say what you must not do. Is it
not so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that statement would stand in most
instances,&#8221; replied Bat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have the excuse,&#8221; said Kretz. &#8220;Herr
Campe is now like a man who is sick. He can&#8217;t
help himself. You have seen that. And so his
people must be his eyes and his ears. They must
also,&#8221; and here the square-cut face tightened
more than ever, &#8220;be his tongue. They must
speak when he cannot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Bat. &#8220;And so you accordingly
seized upon this occasion to lift up your voice in
his behalf.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a stranger here,&#8221; said the German,
who did not seem to listen to what Bat said,
much less understand it. &#8220;You do not know
some things which are known to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat blinked solemnly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me I&#8217;ve heard that, or something
like it, before,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But don&#8217;t take so
much credit for your exclusive information. You
might not have it as safely cornered as you
think.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>&#8220;The tramps&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Kretz, but the big
man stopped him impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tramps grandmothers!&#8221; said he bluntly.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t go on with that kind of thing. I&#8217;m not
an infant in arms to be fed with a bottle. If
you have no real out-in-the-open talk on this
subject, keep quiet about it. I passed the point
where the tramps were long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kretz stood, with frowning brows, looking at
the other. Then his right hand went up in a
salute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>He regarded Bat for still another moment; then
he came a step nearer.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have known Herr Campe for a long
time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite a while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Before you come he spoke much of you,&#8221; said
the German. &#8220;He asked me what I thought of
sending for you. I said,&#8221; candidly, the hand
lifting to another salute, &#8220;not to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not sure. It was a time when a man
could <i>not</i> be sure. All strangers were dangerous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I was a stranger to you only. Didn&#8217;t you
give Mr. Campe any credit for judgment, or
knowledge of people?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Herr Campe,&#8221; said Kretz, &#8220;as I have said, is
like a man who is sick. He does not know who
his friends are. That, sir, was plain to me
when&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; But he stopped shortly at this, his
jaws snapping as though to shut in any words
which might complete the sentence. Then, after
a moment, he said: &#8220;You will be careful of the
strangers?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat nodded.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>&#8220;Excuse,&#8221; said the man, and with another
salute he turned and went on his way along the
river.</p>

<p>Scanlon returned to the castle and was
admitted, much to his surprise, by Miss Knowles.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have gone a great way to-day,&#8221; she
said, with a smile which showed her beautiful
teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite a bit of a stride,&#8221; acknowledged the
big man. &#8220;But then it&#8217;s a bracing morning, and
a fellow should put such days to good use.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kretz seems to think the same,&#8221; said she.
&#8220;He asked leave to go, and I promised to keep
the gate. But,&#8221; and her head shook slowly, &#8220;he
didn&#8217;t cross the hills, as you did; he seemed to
prefer to take the path along the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That so?&#8221; said Bat. And, mentally,
he added: &#8220;Oh, golden Helen, what makes you
always speak in double meanings? This is the
first time I&#8217;ve seen you to-day, and you are at
it already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But then Kretz has shown a preference for the
river of late,&#8221; the girl went on. &#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed
that he likes to stand upon the wall overlooking
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every man to his own fancy,&#8221; spoke Mr.
Scanlon.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be that it has reminded him of some
stream he knew at home in Germany. The
banks are rather picturesque, don&#8217;t you think?
At places they are really wonderful!&#8221;</p>

<p>The big man rolled himself a cigarette and
considered. The river bank, eh? What was all
this talk about it&mdash;this talk, and other things?
He had noticed when he first came to Schwartzberg
that the river had a bank; as a matter of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
fact, it had two of them. But that&#8217;s all it, or
they, had been&mdash;just bank, or banks.</p>

<p>&#8220;However,&#8221; his thought continued, as he
proceeded with his cigarette, &#8220;lately the thing&#8217;s
been getting a whole raft of little attentions.
Last night I heard a fellow fall off of it; this
morning it attracted Ashton-Kirk greatly. The
German, so it seems, likes little walks along and
little observations of it from the wall. And, last,
the golden one is at great pains to put me up in
the facts as she sees them. &#8216;The river bank,&#8217;
says she, as plain as day. &#8216;Take a good, long,
sweeping look at the river bank. And, once
seen, do not forget.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose, though,&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;to one who
has, like you, Mr. Scanlon, spent a great deal of
his life in the wild places, a tame little river like
this has no charm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat lit the cigarette and smoked peacefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you say, the river is tame,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It
has a way of slipping by without forcing your
notice; and in these days a river, like anything
else, if it wants attention, must speak out good
and loud. But though I never have been keen
on bashful rivers, still river banks, of any denomination
whatsoever, have always been a strong
point with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s eyes as she gazed at him were half
smiling, half wondering. She said:</p>

<p>&#8220;One can never be altogether sure of what you
mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat nodded, sorrowfully</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bad, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; remarked he. &#8220;When a
fellow&#8217;s exposed to a thing like that, he&#8217;s sure to
catch it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here there was the sound of wheels without; a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
bell, evidently in the kitchen, rang loudly. Miss
Knowles and Scanlon were still in the courtyard
when Mrs. Kretz made her appearance in answer.
While the woman was opening the gate the girl
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Your friend, Mr. Ashton-Kirk, did not arrive
last night, after all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Bat. &#8220;But then, as I said, you
never know when to expect him. He&#8217;s one of
those fellows who have their own ideas about
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>The opened gate showed a waggon outside, one
which Scanlon had noticed more than once before.
A package was handed to Mrs. Kretz, who at
once came in and relocked the gate.</p>

<p>Miss Knowles held out her hand as though to
take the package. There was a sweet smile upon
her face, but in the movement there was a swiftness,
an eagerness which Scanlon could not help
but notice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for me!&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the woman, sullenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;For Miss Hohenlo, then. Give it to me. I
will take it to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reluctantly Mrs. Kretz handed her the parcel,
and the girl, with a smile and a nod to Scanlon,
crossed the courtyard and disappeared.</p>

<p>The woman fumbled at the bolts of the gate for
a few moments; it was plain to Bat that she
desired to say something but was at a loss as to
how to begin.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t care to have any of your work
taken off your hands, I see,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>The woman shook her head; her heavy face
still wore the sullen look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Always,&#8221; she said, &#8220;she does that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; asked Bat, &#8220;what of it? I don&#8217;t see
much in her carrying a small package upstairs.
It&#8217;ll not tire her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Kretz folded her strong, thick-fingered
hands in her apron, and again she shook her
head in a stubborn sort of way.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It is not what you
see. It is never what you see in Schwartzberg,
but always something else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Agreed,&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon. &#8220;That&#8217;s exactly
how I feel about it myself. But,&#8221; and he looked
at her with the interest of a prospector who is
about to turn over some fresh soil, &#8220;just what
is the idea this time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Always,&#8221; said Mrs. Kretz, &#8220;when a parcel
comes by the waggon, she is here to see. Never
once does she let me take it in myself. And
never once does she take it where it belongs until
she has looked inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Scanlon. &#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More than once I have watched,&#8221; said the
woman. &#8220;It is not my place, but I want to keep
trouble from the house. Hours she will spend
looking and searching. Then she will tie the
bundle up as it was, and take it to whomever it
is for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat considered this for a space.</p>

<p>&#8220;The mail now, does she do the same with
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes,&#8221; replied the woman, &#8220;when it is
a package.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Scanlon. &#8220;When it&#8217;s a package,
eh? Never when it is anything else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more Mr. Scanlon considered.</p>

<p>&#8220;That looks,&#8221; said he, &#8220;as if Miss Knowles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
were interested in the coming of something of
some little bulk.&#8221; He stroked his shaven jaw
and looked at the woman. &#8220;Now I wonder what
it is she&#8217;s looking for?&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman returned the look, and again
Scanlon saw she desired to say something, but
did not know how to begin.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;If you&#8217;ve got any
suggestions to make, don&#8217;t be backward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you would see her searching and looking,&#8221;
said the woman, &#8220;there is a window near the
stable. She always locks herself in that room.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Kretz then returned to her kitchen, and
Scanlon leaned with his back against the wall and
pondered. That he might the better do this, he
took out his tobacco pouch and the little sheaf of
papers; then he carefully shaped another
cigarette. With the pale smoke hovering about
him, he turned the question over carefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;It stands like this,&#8221; he told himself. &#8220;Something
is doing that threatens to knock out a
friend of mine. Said friend asks me to give him
help. This I do. In the process of helping I
run smack into the fact that the girl he&#8217;s in love
with is on the cross. She stands in with the
parties who are trying to get him. Mixed up
in her efforts in his direction is a desire to see
what&#8217;s inside all the packages which come to the
house. I have a chance, maybe, to find our what
the reason is&mdash;by peeping in at a window. Question
before the committee on morals: Is it
permissible to peep under such circumstances?&#8221;</p>

<p>Evidently the said committee went into session
at once, and a great cloud of smoke arose above
its meeting place. Mr. Scanlon, after a space,
threw the cigarette away with decision.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>&#8220;As it&#8217;s a case of out and out crookedness, the
thing can be done without sacrifice to the finer
feelings. Therefore I&#8217;ll go and take a peep at
the lady with the package.&#8221;</p>

<p>So down the courtyard went Mr. Scanlon; at
the near end of the stable was a grated window
some dozen feet from the ground; a ladder stood
under it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Frau Kretz, I suppose, got up this way,&#8221;
said Bat. &#8220;Therefore, so shall I.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peering in through the grating he saw that the
room was the one the servants used for storage.
At a table stood Miss Knowles, and the parcel,
opened, lay before her.</p>

<p>The room was a dark one, but the girl had
lighted a large swinging lamp and the rays fell
downward upon the table.</p>

<p>The observant eyes of Mr. Scanlon went all
about the place; nothing in the room was missed.</p>

<p>&#8220;For you see,&#8221; mused he, &#8220;a fellow, in a case
like this, never knows just what belongs to the
game being played, and what doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a high ceilinged room, narrow, but long;
shelves were upon two sides of it, shelves loaded
with packets and jars and labeled boxes.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many of them are in on this business of
the packet?&#8221; was Bat&#8217;s mental query. &#8220;They
all look innocent enough, of course; they seem to
be simple things having to do with the kitchen
and the preparation of meals. But are they what
they seem to be? Or are they like a good many
things about this house&mdash;putting up an innocent
front, but, in reality, working as something else.&#8221;</p>

<p>The big man had come to a mental state in
which he took nothing for granted. His stay at
Schwartzberg had been one which shook his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
confidence in his own judgment; there was
nothing his senses told him that he could accept
without investigation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The good old days when a fellow could take
a glance at a thing, and then pass it on, are gone
by,&#8221; he&#8217;d sadly told himself more than once.</p>

<p>&#8220;And they may never come again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The parcel contained papers, small rolls, each
tied with a tape. Carefully the girl undid the
fastenings of one of these; slowly the sheets were
unrolled and separated. Then, one at a time,
they passed under the eye of Miss Knowles; one
at a time they were laid aside; and when the little
packet was examined, it was re-rolled and tied
with the tape once more. Profound was the
amazement of Mr. Scanlon, perched upon the
ladder outside; he felt almost like rubbing his
eyes: he could scarcely believe his senses. For
each sheet of the paper was absolutely blank.</p>

<p>Another and still another of the rolls was gone
over in a like manner; each blank sheet was
studied; each little packet was faithfully re-tied;
and when all were done, the girl stood looking
down at them thoughtfully. The yellow lamp-light
glinted in her hair; her smooth skin looked
inexpressibly fair; the pink in her cheeks was like
the softly-sunned side of a peach. For a long
time she stood without moving; then she assembled
the rolls of blank paper and carefully
wrapped them as they had been when she received
them from Mrs. Kretz. After this she turned
off the light, and with the package in her hand
she left the room.</p>

<p>Mr. Scanlon stepped down from the ladder, his
face a study. Walking the length of the courtyard,
his hands in his pockets, his cheeks puffed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
out like small balloons, he fell once more to
pondering. But evidently his cogitations did not
bring any enlightenment, for after a while he
removed his hands from his pockets and elevated
them above his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m done,&#8221; stated he. &#8220;I am completely
and absolutely beat. Every minute I spend in
this place puts it up to me more and more plainly
that I was never meant for anything but elementary
purposes. After this I will gaze and not even
try to think. I will record like the camera and
the phonograph and leave the developing for a
professional. I could stand this stuff about the
northwest and also the play of the sick man in the
moonlight. But when it comes to otherwise
competent young ladies displaying intense interest
in sheets of blank paper, I&#8217;m done!&#8221;</p>

<p>And once again Mr. Scanlon had recourse to
his tobacco pouch; once again he rolled himself a
comforting smoke; and once again he fell into
amazement after amazement regarding the things
which were going on about him.</p>

<small>SHOWS HOW THE GREAT SWORD WAS MISSED
FROM THE WALL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE day passed slowly for Scanlon; he put in
a few hours with the newspapers, which
were always brought to Schwartzberg
about noon; then he selected an armful of likely
looking books and took them to his room.</p>

<p>But the adventures therein related were not to
his taste. He was in no humour for the accumulation
of unexplained incident; what he wanted at
that particular time was clarity&mdash;a breeze which
would blow through the castle of intrigue and
drive out the obscuring vapours.</p>

<p>&#8220;This fellow,&#8221; remarked he, turning the leaves
of one of the books, &#8220;is too much like myself.
Here he starts out under a cloud; and as he goes
along, instead of getting rid of it, he adds to it.
At page one hundred he has a collection of clouds
the like of which I never saw in a book before.
Then they proceed to break, and he has a fine
little storm on his hands, with thunder and lightning
and wind. If it only cleared up then, all
right. But it doesn&#8217;t. The clouds still stick
around; the fellow never gets a chance to do anything,
for he can&#8217;t see far enough ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw the book upon the table and yawned.
Then he proceeded to dress for dinner.</p>

<p>Once more he was surprised to find that Miss
Hohenlo would dine with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really,&#8221; she declared, girlishly, &#8220;I seem to
be in splendid spirits. I haven&#8217;t been well enough
to come down to dinner for ever so long before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
last night. I don&#8217;t understand it. There must
be something in the air.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very possible,&#8221; spoke Miss Knowles,
smilingly. &#8220;I think I have detected it myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the two women talked, Campe engaged
his guest in conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kretz tells me that there was a stranger about
the place to-day,&#8221; said he, with an assumption of
carelessness, but with a troubled look in his eyes.</p>

<p>Scanlon nodded easily.</p>

<p>&#8220;A sick fellow,&#8221; said he. &#8220;From the inn over
yonder. Something of a botanist, I think. He
said he was looking for specimens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Botanists don&#8217;t usually select November as a
time for their work,&#8221; observed Campe. &#8220;That
was a subterfuge, and that he thought it necessary
to use one shows his intentions to be at least
open to question.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat acknowledged this with a nod.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a few of us ever lie without a reason,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>Miss Hohenlo, who had turned to listen, gesticulated
admiringly and in such a way that her
small white hands were well displayed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have such a delightfully straightforward
way with you, Mr. Scanlon,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think
it&#8217;s so refreshing. I suppose it comes of living so
long in the West among people who have none
of the subtleties of over-civilization, and among
the grand wild scenery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; said Bat, &#8220;or it might be something
else. You can&#8217;t always put the brand on a
straightforward talker, and his reasons for being
such, any more than you can on a botanist who
picks the wrong time of the year to carry on his
researches. I knew a fellow named Cameron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
once who kept the &#8216;Deuce High&#8217; at Cripple
Creek, and was the most civil fellow I ever met.
His next best thing was straightforward talk,
and he used to reel it off by the mile. Everybody
took it in until one night, in the middle of a
speech, somebody caught him slipping cards from
the bottom of the pack. After that they sort of
lost confidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a wild, reckless life,&#8221; sighed Miss
Hohenlo, her pretty hands before her face, as
though to shut it out. &#8220;And yet,&#8221; with an air,
&#8220;I could almost wish I were a man so that I
might take part in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to be a man to do a little
thing like that,&#8221; said Scanlon. He addressed
Miss Hohenlo, but as he spoke his eyes were upon
Miss Knowles. &#8220;Some women run a dead heat
with the speediest of men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, not really!&#8221; exclaimed the spinster.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t mean it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been my experience,&#8221; said Bat, &#8220;that the
ladies are not a bit different from men in their
undertakings. They just go about it differently.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Knowles laughed a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not quite sure whether you are complimenting
us or no,&#8221; said she. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t agree
with you at any rate. No woman, for instance,
could have done what you did last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;She could,&#8221; stated he. &#8220;What is there to
walking quietly down a dark hall? Don&#8217;t you
think a woman would have the nerve to do
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Calmly he studied the beautiful face before
him, and he saw a deeper tint creep into the pink
of her cheeks.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>&#8220;Oh, perhaps that,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;And more,&#8221; insisted Bat. &#8220;Much more.
What did I do but hold a quiet conversation
with the burglar as he went about his work. Is
that too much for a woman to do? I&#8217;ll venture
that one of them has talked just as quietly with a
housebreaker, and almost under the same conditions,
before now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The blue eyes of Miss Knowles fixed themselves
upon him in a wide open stare. There was a
smile upon her lips, but in the eyes he could see
something else&mdash;something very like fear.</p>

<p>Campe, as was usual with him, had grown
absent-minded, and brooding; apparently his
mind was filled with suspicions as to the purpose
of the supposed prowler of the morning; at any
rate he took no part in the conversation; indeed,
he did not seem to hear it.</p>

<p>It was the voice of Miss Hohenlo which broke
the silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Grace,&#8221; said she, &#8220;you look frightened.
You are really growing nervy. And once
I thought you were, as you look, a Brunhilde.&#8221;
She leaned toward the girl, looking at her curiously.
&#8220;And the mere idea of a woman engaging
in such an adventure has frightened you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Knowles shook her golden head and
laughed. Her blue eyes were filled with amusement
and the fear had vanished.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was trying to imagine myself in such a
position. And I think the result was too vivid.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Mr. Scanlon seemed doubtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it was that,&#8221; spoke he, confidently.
&#8220;It must have been something else.
You&#8217;d go through such an adventure and never
wink an eye.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>Miss Hohenlo clasped her hands with delicate
satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Scanlon,&#8221; said she, &#8220;I&#8217;m delighted
that you won&#8217;t permit Grace to think meanly of
herself. For, when you&#8217;ve come to know her as I
do, she is really a wonderful person.&#8221; Here the
eyes of the two women met in a look so rapid that
Scanlon was unable to interpret it. &#8220;You are
quite right. I have the greatest faith in her
courage, and what I said a few moments ago in
doubt of it was merely a jest. Grace, you know,
would really dare anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please, Miss Hohenlo,&#8221; said the girl, in
protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would, my dear; you know you would.
It would only require,&#8221; and here the faded eyes
went from the beautiful face of Miss Knowles to
the attentive one of Mr. Scanlon, &#8220;it would only
require the necessity. Let that be sufficient,&#8221;
said Miss Hohenlo, nodding quite positively, &#8220;and
Grace would be equal to anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;what you say were
true. For there are many such occasions,&#8221; and
she smiled at Scanlon, &#8220;which arise and demand
to be met. And I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t do the work
very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this Scanlon fell into a silence, not an
absent one such as Campe seemed plunged in, but
alert and observant. When appealed to he
replied briefly, but he did not lose a word or miss
an expression of either face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; said he, mentally, &#8220;is where I break
my new-made resolution. For the time being I
am not a non-reasoning recorder. I must reason,
or I&#8217;ll sink. And as something seems on the
move between the ladies, I don&#8217;t want to do that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>&#8220;You would do anything well, my dear Grace.&#8221;
Here Miss Hohenlo&#8217;s white hand smoothed her
faded hair. &#8220;Anything in the world. But being
clever and ingenious and persistent, I am sorry to
say, does not always bring success. And if you
have failed in any of your undertakings it is this,
and not yourself, that is to blame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could think so,&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;Perhaps
I would then have the energy to go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Energy!&#8221; Miss Hohenlo laughed gently.
&#8220;Oh, Grace, as if you could ever lack that&mdash;you
who are energy itself. Mr. Scanlon, please speak
to her again; she will insist upon doing herself
these little injustices.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tones of the two women were mild, their
looks were kind, their words were inconsequent;
and yet underneath all these things the big man
seemed to detect a rapid play of meaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s there,&#8221; said he, to himself, &#8220;but, as usual,
I am not getting it. However, one thing is plain&mdash;the
elderly lady is on top of the younger one;
and if it is at all possible, I&#8217;m going to find out
how it is before the night is done.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this purpose events seemed to favour
Scanlon. Miss Knowles proposed a game of
billiards with Campe after dinner, and as Miss
Hohenlo declined, Bat declined also; and so he
was left alone with her in the great room where
the tapestries hung.</p>

<p>The spinster caressed the strings of the gilt
harp gently; Bat lounged in a deep chair and
talked to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you lived in this country very long?&#8221;
he asked her, finally.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only two years,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>Bat expressed his astonishment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>&#8220;But you speak the language so well,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>She laughed, and the harp murmured under
her touch.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are thinking of my having lived in
Mexico, or in Germany, before that,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Well, I have. But, you see, I was educated in
England and the United States.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said the big man; &#8220;that accounts
for it then.&#8221; He watched her for a little and
listened to the soft sounds she drew from the
strings. &#8220;But Miss Knowles,&#8221; he said, &#8220;she
speaks the language very well also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She should,&#8221; replied Miss Hohenlo calmly,
&#8220;seeing that she is American.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Bat, apparently much amazed.
&#8220;I was sure she was German.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Hohenlo laughed quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very easy for Grace to create
impressions,&#8221; she said. &#8220;She has talent in that
direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be a bit surprised if she had a lot
of it,&#8221; agreed Mr. Scanlon. &#8220;But it was the
yellow hair and so on, I guess, that made me
think her a German.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She dresses to conform with the background,&#8221;
said Miss Hohenlo gently. &#8220;Dear Grace, she is
such a beauty. The braids of yellow hair and
the strength of her outline go very well with a
place like Schwartzberg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been together a long time,&#8221; said Mr.
Scanlon, &#8220;and you think a lot of her, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s been with me since Frederic&#8217;s father
died,&#8221; said Miss Hohenlo. &#8220;She was the
daughter of a friend and business partner. I am
very fond of her.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon, carefully, &#8220;your
nephew is, also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Frederic!&#8221; Miss Hohenlo struck the strings
and they reverberated thrillingly. &#8220;He loves
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had supposed something like that was the
case,&#8221; admitted Bat. &#8220;He never said anything,
you know, but a fellow can usually size up these
matters.&#8221; There was a pause during which the
harp spoke murmuringly, and Bat kept the time
upon the arms of his chair with his fingers. &#8220;And
do you know, when I did finally size it up,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;it gave me quite a start.&#8221;</p>

<p>The beautiful hands left the strings and clasped
themselves together; Miss Hohenlo turned an
incredulous face toward the speaker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gave <i>you</i> a start!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Oh, Mr.
Scanlon, one can&#8217;t imagine anything like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Bat, &#8220;maybe you wouldn&#8217;t think
so, seeing I turn the scales at about fourteen
stone, and was brought up in the open. But
start I did on that occasion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221; and the dull eyes of the spinster
were full of wonder. &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your nephew,&#8221; said the big man, &#8220;is a friend
of mine. And a fellow never likes to see a friend
venturing into a thing which might not be
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Hohenlo shook one pretty finger at him
girlishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you bachelors,&#8221; she said; &#8220;you have such
a dread of marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nature always helps its own,&#8221; said Bat.
&#8220;If it can&#8217;t provide you with a courage to meet a
thing, it supplies a fear which makes you duck
and in that way save yourself. But,&#8221; he frowned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
at a rug on the floor before him, and stroked his
chin, &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t of marriage I was thinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Bat, &#8220;it was the girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes were still on the rug, but for all that
he caught the sudden tenseness of her attitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grace!&#8221; she said, and there was a sharpness
in her voice which was new to him. &#8220;What do
you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>The big man studied the rug under his bent
brows. He felt that the situation, now that he
had brought it to this point, was a delicate one,
and knew that he must be careful. Indeed, it
was so exceedingly delicate and required so much
care that under other circumstances he would not
have ventured to tackle it. But he wanted to
help Campe; his curiosity was aroused, and he
felt convinced that there was something hostile
between the two women. And so he launched
himself upon waters which might prove a mill
pond or a whirlpool.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Knowles,&#8221; stated he, &#8220;is a good looker.
She&#8217;s got a figure that makes the best of them
look like cripples, and I never want to see a nicer
smile. Along these lines she&#8217;s a winner, and I
have nothing but praise for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Miss Hohenlo, attentively, &#8220;along
some others you feel that you can <i>not</i> praise her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat acknowledged this by a gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that I am very definite in the matter,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;for I&#8217;m not. You see&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; but he
stopped short as he was about to add something
else, and after looking into the dull, uninteresting
face before him, he said: &#8220;You&#8217;ve been here at
Schwartzberg for some time, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since early summer. When Frederic wrote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
that he was here and meant to stay for a time, I
was overjoyed. You see, I love the memory of
the old count, my ancestor, and this place is so
full of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Being given to staying indoors and to music
and such,&#8221; said Bat, &#8220;you&#8217;d not be likely to see
as much or notice as many things as some one
who goes about more; but, for all that, you must
have seen that there&#8217;s something the matter here
in Schwartzberg.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Hohenlo arose; leaving the harp, she
walked to a window and stood for a moment
looking out into the darkness. When she turned,
the dull eyes were filled with tears; the small face
was piteous with pleading. All the affectation
had vanished; her manner was simple and
direct.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Scanlon,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you are a friend of
Frederic&#8217;s, and I am glad of the chance to talk
with you upon this subject. As you say, there is
something amiss in Schwartzberg; I&#8217;ve been
aware of it for months. But my nephew is
unapproachable upon the subject; I am ashamed
to say he is more like a frightened child than a
man whose life has been put in danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Deep waters,&#8221; acknowledged Bat. &#8220;And
they may even run deeper still.&#8221;</p>

<p>The beautiful hands went out in a despairing
gesture at this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope not!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;For his
sake I hope not. And it&#8217;s a torture to me to see
him so.&#8221; She was silent for a moment, and then
went on: &#8220;I have given him every opportunity
to confide in me, but he will not. And so, Mr.
Scanlon, I am like a stranger. Danger, even
death, perhaps, is hovering over the house, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
know nothing except the little that comes to me
by chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since I&#8217;ve been here I&#8217;ve felt about the same
way,&#8221; said Scanlon, &#8220;though, of course, I haven&#8217;t
so much reason as you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could not speak to Frederic, and I must not
speak to the servants. So,&#8221; said Miss Hohenlo,
&#8220;there was left only&mdash;Grace.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again there came the pause, this time longer
than before. Finally Scanlon said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>She came nearer to him. Never had she looked
plainer or more angular; never had her eyes
seemed duller or her hair with less life.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I could not speak to her. There was a
something which stood between us&mdash;perhaps the
same feeling which you had&mdash;and it held me back.&#8221;
One of the delicate hands went out and rested on
Scanlon&#8217;s sleeve. &#8220;What is it?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>But the big man could only shake his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;At times,&#8221; said Miss Hohenlo, &#8220;she comes to
me with the strangest requests. They seem to be
without meaning, and yet, somehow, I am afraid
of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Requests?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They seem silly,&#8221; said the spinster, a dazed
look in the dull eyes. &#8220;I&#8217;ve tried to give a meaning
to them, but never could. For example, she&#8217;ll
often, of an evening, ask me to go to a window
and pretend to be interested in the direction of the
wind. And she makes me promise not to tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jove!&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then she has a way of jesting about my playing
of the harp, and of other things which seem
to be odd in tone and in meaning. I&#8217;ve never
been able to understand them.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>Scanlon nodded; he could readily see this as
the things had made the same impression upon
himself. Then, guardedly, he began to speak.
Little by little he told Miss Hohenlo of the numerous
things which had attracted his attention to
Miss Knowles since his arrival at Schwartzberg.
And when he had done, she stood staring at him
like a small scared animal.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s dreadful!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Who would ever
have dreamed of such a thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>From the courtyard there came a dull complaining
sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; said Scanlon, in surprise; &#8220;what&#8217;s
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the gate,&#8221; spoke Miss Hohenlo. &#8220;Some
one is opening it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The night, though the month was November,
was an exceedingly mild one, and the windows
were partly open. Through one of these they
looked down into the courtyard. Kretz was at
the gate drawing the bolts, and beside him stood
Miss Knowles, a long, muffling wrap hanging to
her feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is going out,&#8221; breathed Miss Hohenlo.</p>

<p>The big gate creaked open, and for a moment
the girl and the grim-faced German spoke in
low tones. He seemed expostulating, but she
appeared to brush his words aside as being of
no consequence. Suddenly their talk ceased.
Campe appeared, a cap upon his head, a stick in
his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Frederic!&#8221; Miss Hohenlo was amazed.
&#8220;He, too, is going!&#8221;</p>

<p>The gate swung to behind them, and the
sergeant-major shot the bolts.</p>

<p>&#8220;The last night those two were out there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
among the hills,&#8221; said Scanlon, &#8220;he was slashed&mdash;and
maybe with the sword which she had taken
out of this room.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this a cry came from the woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; she gasped, and pointed toward the
narrow strip of tapestry between the windows, the
place where the great sword usually hung.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jingo!&#8221; cried Scanlon. &#8220;It&#8217;s gone!&#8221;</p>

<small>SPEAKS OF A HARP WHICH WAS PLAYED
IN SILENCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE hung the long strip of tapestry
between the two windows, but the huge
naked blade which usually rested against
it was missing. For a moment or two Scanlon
could not take his eyes from the spot; he was
fascinated by the possibilities of the discovery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where can it be?&#8221; asked Miss Hohenlo.
&#8220;What could it have been taken for?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat took his eyes from the place where the
sword had hung, and they fixed themselves upon
the speaker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Under the circumstances,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and in
the face of what I&#8217;ve just told you, can&#8217;t you
imagine what it <i>might</i> have been taken for?&#8221;</p>

<p>She put her hands before her face as if to shut
out the idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; she said, helplessly. &#8220;No!
Surely not that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Scanlon, and he drew a deep
breath as he said it, &#8220;maybe not. But I&#8217;ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
caught the notion so strongly that I don&#8217;t think
I&#8217;ll take a chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and she looked at him
fearfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to find out whatever is fixed to
take place. And, if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I&#8217;m going
to do it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Swiftly the big man left the room and lightly he
ran down the stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;The gate!&#8221; said he to Kretz, who stood in
the courtyard. &#8220;Open it!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man stood looking at him, a curious
expression upon his face; for a moment it seemed
to Scanlon that he was about to refuse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick!&#8221; said Scanlon. All the suspicions
that he&#8217;d had of the German since coming to
Schwartzberg were brought to a head in an
instant. His strong jaw grew rigid and his
tone was almost menacing.</p>

<p>The sergeant-major threw the bolts and turned
the keys sullenly. As the gate opened, Scanlon
passed out.</p>

<p>The big man looked about. The moon lurked
behind the heavy mass of clouds which covered
the sky, but some of its radiance trickled through
and made things visible in a dim sort of way.
Along the path leading west from the castle he
detected a movement, and at once he set out in
that direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of something like this once or twice
before,&#8221; murmured he. &#8220;Decoys have been used
since men began to find it was surer to hit when
the punch wasn&#8217;t expected. Though,&#8221; and he
shoved out his chin, &#8220;I can&#8217;t say the facts make
her that sort of a decoy. If there&#8217;s a blow to be
struck, it seems to me, she&#8217;ll strike it herself.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>Scanlon&#8217;s stride was long and quiet; the path
was of well-beaten earth and free of stones, so
he stepped out freely without fear of detection.
Finally he began to make out the figures ahead
of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There they are,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and going along
very contentedly.&#8221; He put a hand to each side
of his mouth and lifted his voice. &#8220;Hello!&#8221; he
called.</p>

<p>Young Campe wheeled like a flash, his hand
going to his hip.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Scanlon. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t
trouble about that.&#8221;</p>

<p>He approached hastily, his hands upraised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bat!&#8221; said Campe, in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;We hadn&#8217;t expected you, Mr. Scanlon,&#8221; spoke
Miss Knowles, sweetly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I suppose not,&#8221; said the big man, and his
tone was dry. &#8220;I just thought I&#8217;d take a stretch
along the path.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s such a splendid night for that,&#8221; said Miss
Knowles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not too bright,&#8221; exclaimed Campe. &#8220;A
fellow doesn&#8217;t make such a target as he would on
a moonlit night. And yet with plenty of light
to see by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Moonlight has its disadvantages, of course,&#8221;
admitted Mr. Scanlon. &#8220;And with matters as
they now seem to be, you can&#8217;t do better than
take everything into account.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl and the young man went along on the
path, and doggedly Scanlon followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It always pays,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;not to slip
anything when it comes to a calculation. Doing
that has cost many a man his life&mdash;and even
more. I recall one time out in the Black Hills<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
country&mdash;but,&#8221; inquiringly, &#8220;Maybe you don&#8217;t
care to hear about that just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, please,&#8221; said Miss Knowles.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was riding with Captain Marsh&#8217;s troop in
chase of some Sioux who&#8217;d raided a little place
called &#8216;Soldier Hat.&#8217; They&#8217;d taken all the fire-water
they could lug&mdash;this, like as not, being the
principal object of the raid&mdash;and then headed for
a camp they had among the rocks. We got word
six hours later, and made good time after them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the night?&#8221; asked Miss Knowles.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was night when we pulled up about half a
mile from their camp. Marsh wanted to see just
how things lay for a rush on them; he didn&#8217;t ask
any of his men to go, but went himself. He&#8217;d
reckoned on everything, so he thought, but when
he&#8217;d crept within fifty feet of where the Sioux
lay asleep something began to strike the stones&mdash;chink&mdash;chank&mdash;chink&mdash;chank!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His spurs,&#8221; said Miss Knowles.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d remembered his spurs, and taken them
off. But his sword had slipped and began to
trail; before he could snatch it up the camp was
awake, and in two minutes the reds were off.
The one thing he hadn&#8217;t taken into his calculations,&#8221;
said the big man, slowly, &#8220;was the sword.
And that&#8217;s what gave him away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what a pity,&#8221; said the girl. She turned
her head and looked over her shoulder at Scanlon
as she spoke; it was too shadowy to catch the
expression in her face, but in her voice was that
little break which is apt to appear when one&#8217;s
breath is short and quickly taken. &#8220;Success
meant so much to him, too, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d had his chance and missed it,&#8221; said Bat.
&#8220;And,&#8221; shaking his head, &#8220;who&#8217;d ever have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
thought of such a thing as that giving him
away?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl drew the long muffling wrap about her
carefully; she shivered a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had no idea it would be so cold,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps we&#8217;d better return,&#8221; said Campe,
solicitously.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m really
chilled.&#8221;</p>

<p>The big man smiled satirically through the
gloom as he trailed along behind, but now in the
direction of the castle.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s pretty clever,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;and got
plenty of nerve, but it takes long experience in
any game to stand up under the unexpected little
shock. That&#8217;s the thing that usually gets them
when they&#8217;re off their balance, and spills the beans
all over the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kretz seemed surprised when he opened the
gate for them; his eyes sought out those of the
girl, but she passed into the house quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did not stay,&#8221; said the sergeant-major to
Campe.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; it was not so pleasant as it seemed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kretz shook his head and muttered something,
and Scanlon felt his eyes still upon them as they
entered the narrow doorway.</p>

<p>Miss Knowles had gone on up the stairs; they
could hear her feet pat-patting quickly on the
stones. Campe seemed about to follow when
Scanlon said:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are not doing anything particular for
the next half hour, I&#8217;d like to speak to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said Campe.</p>

<p>They entered the big room hung with the heads
of boars and stags and the trophies of arms.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>&#8220;I am going to talk to you like a Dutch uncle,&#8221;
remarked Mr. Scanlon, calmly, as he stood beside
one of the massive oaken tables. &#8220;Sit down,
light a pipe, and listen.&#8221;</p>

<p>From a shelf he took a stone jar and a brace of
pipes, with bowls of baked clay and long reed
stems. The pipes were filled with tobacco from
the jar and lighted; then they sat down at the
table facing each other. Campe smoked quietly,
tilted back in his chair, his eyes upon the floor.
Scanlon examined him keenly, with the manner
of a man who had something of a job before him,
and meant to go about it as carefully as he could.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was pretty close to three weeks ago that I
first came here,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And in those three
weeks I&#8217;ve had a sort of miscellaneous time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed yourself,&#8221; spoke
Campe. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve been rather lacking in
many ways, but things are in such shape with me
just now that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Bat stopped him with a wave of the hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;The shape that things are in with you just
now,&#8221; said the big man, &#8220;is what this talk is
going to be about. You couldn&#8217;t have brought
the thing forward at a better moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Campe&#8217;s fingers tapped nervously upon the
edge of the table; Scanlon blew a cloud of smoke
toward the ceiling and watched it curl and shift
formlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve never told me why you asked me
here,&#8221; said the big man. &#8220;And I never asked.
But just the same I dropped to the facts in the
first couple of days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Campe placed his pipe upon the table, and
stared at the speaker with frightened eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Bat, interrupting him, &#8220;I <i>don&#8217;t</i>
mean that. What the inside of this affair of yours
is&mdash;the real reason for it all&mdash;I don&#8217;t know. But
in the outside I am pretty well informed. You
are cooped up here with enemies all about you.
Now at a single glance, a fellow wouldn&#8217;t say they
were a very dangerous lot; but,&#8221; wrinkling his
forehead, &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen them work a little, and I&#8217;ll
say for them that they&#8217;ve got stuff I can&#8217;t hit;
and from all appearances, it&#8217;s the same way with
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Scanlon paused and took a few pulls at
the pipe to assure himself that the tobacco was
still burning. Campe said nothing during the
silence, and the big man took occasion to go on.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you never volunteered anything,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think it was my place to ask questions.
So I&#8217;ve watched the thing move along, and all the
time it got tighter and tighter, and sharper and
sharper; and now, to-night, I feel that I can&#8217;t
draw another full breath until I tell you what I
think, and what you ought to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Campe.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a civilized community,&#8221; said Scanlon, &#8220;the
first thing a man does, when pestered as you&#8217;re
being, is to call in the police. That you&#8217;ve kept so
close, both with me and the police, shows that
you&#8217;ve got a secret on your hands&mdash;something
that you&#8217;re not anxious to spread around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; asked the young man once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not trying to pry into your affairs,&#8221; spoke
Scanlon. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to know the object of
the parties at the inn. And I&#8217;m not advising you
to consult the police, if you think you ought not
to do so. But what I am wanting you to do is to
carry your idea regarding me a step further.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>&#8220;I hardly think I understand you,&#8221; said the
other, looking at Scanlon searchingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will in a minute,&#8221; spoke the big man.
&#8220;I was called in to help, wasn&#8217;t I? Good!
But, willing and all as I was, I wasn&#8217;t the right
party. I can handle small matters that are set
down plainly for the eye to see, but what you
really want is a man that&#8217;s capable of putting the
hook into those that the eye can&#8217;t see, and one, at
the same time, not having anything to do with
the police.&#8221;</p>

<p>Campe smiled faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is an ideal combination,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;But where is such a person to be found?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Scanlon, &#8220;that I could provide
such a one if you feel inclined to talk to him&mdash;a
fellow who is naturally put together for getting to
the bottom of things. I&#8217;ve seen him do one or
two stunts since I&#8217;ve known him that were fancy
bits of reasoning, and I&#8217;ve been told of some
others that made my eyebrows curl.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a silence of some duration. The
young man took up the pipe once more and
relighted it. Finally he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no use in my attempting to deny the
situation here at Schwartzberg,&#8221; said he, slowly.
&#8220;I had hoped to keep it hidden, but the last few
days have shown me that such a thing is impossible.
Your judgment that the thing behind it all
is one which I hesitate to make public is correct.
At first I wanted to fight it out&mdash;alone, but I see
that this, also, cannot be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>He leaned toward Scanlon, his hands upon the
edge of the table, desperation in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I need help,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I need it perhaps as
badly as it was ever needed before. For not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
only is my life in danger, but my sanity as
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut! tut!&#8221; said the big man. &#8220;Hold tight!
We&#8217;ll get you out of this with everything
standing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That there is some one whom you know&mdash;a
private person&mdash;who has shown cleverness in
entanglements brought to his notice is, perhaps,
fortunate.&#8221; The young man looked at Scanlon,
his face twitching nervously. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll have to
give the matter some consideration. I am not
sure that I can take any one into my confidence
without doing an injustice.&#8221;</p>

<p>He got up and stood for some time troubled of
face and with the pinched, hollow look which
Scanlon had watched since coming to the castle.
Then he said, simply:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;m tired, now Bat, and I&#8217;ll go to bed.
Somehow,&#8221; and his smile was wan and a little
piteous, &#8220;I don&#8217;t seem as able as I was a short
time ago. This thing has taken some of the snap
out of me.&#8221; He shook the big man by the hand,
adding, &#8220;Thanks, old man, for the way you&#8217;ve
taken this thing, and also for the offer regarding
your friend. I&#8217;ll turn him over in my mind for a
little, and then I&#8217;ll tell you just what I&#8217;ve concluded
to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>After he had gone Bat sat at the oaken table
and smoked. Three times he refilled the pipe
with the reed stem, and three times he knocked
out the ash. Then he also arose to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s about ripe for a consultation with
Kirk,&#8221; he told himself. &#8220;And the quicker he
makes up his mind to it, the better. For this
little game is getting so close that I&#8217;m beginning
to feel it pinch.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>He yawned widely and started for his room.</p>

<p>Now, after the way of most big outdoor men,
Mr. Scanlon, in his moments of relaxation, was
not at all light footed. Neither was he naturally
given to stealthy ways. But since coming to
Schwartzberg he had acquired both.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have fallen upon me like a couple of
garments,&#8221; he had acknowledged to himself more
than once. &#8220;And I&#8217;ve got to going around as
softly as a pair of gum shoes shot through a
Maxim silencer.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was in the hall, not far from the head of the
stairs, that he had seen the soft man on the night
before; this fact must have been subconsciously
active, for he now slowly lifted his head above the
level of the floor, his eyes, as he did so, glancing
swiftly ahead. Both the hall and the stairway
were dim; and before his eye had caught anything,
his ear got a soft step and the gentle closing
of a door.</p>

<p>&#8220;The golden Helen,&#8221; he said, a moment later,
as he caught the outlines of Miss Knowles.
&#8220;What now, I wonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>With the light foot and the stealthy manner,
Bat had acquired the habit of suspicion. He had
reached the state where every movement which he
did not understand was an occasion for inquiry;
each unexplained sound caused him to prick up
his ears. Under ordinary circumstances the
gentle closing of the door and the quiet movements
of Miss Knowles would have passed unnoticed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But these are no ordinary times,&#8221; he told
himself. &#8220;The golden one is a very busy person,
and so, when she goes pit-patting around, there&#8217;s
no harm in looking after her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl flitted down the hall, and Scanlon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
quietly followed. But in the dusk he lost sight of
her. Reaching the place where he had last seen
her, he stared around; but nothing but shadows
met his eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone into one of the rooms,&#8221; said he to himself.
&#8220;But which, and why?&#8221;</p>

<p>As he could think of nothing to do in the
matter, he was turning away; but just then a
thought struck him. At the next turn in the hall
was the staircase leading to the next floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose she has gone up there?&#8221; said
he.</p>

<p>The floor above was not used by any of the
members of the household, though all the rooms
were completely furnished and open. Why any
one should go up there Mr. Scanlon could not
think.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; reasoned he, &#8220;in Schwartzberg you
can never tell. So I&#8217;ll climb the stairs just for
luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>He proceeded to do so, not neglecting his light
step. The upper hall was in complete darkness,
save for what faint light the windows admitted,
and he stood at the head of the stairs, looking
carefully up and down. After a pause he started
along the passage; half-way to its end he stopped
suddenly.</p>

<p>A dozen steps away was an alcove, about which
were some partly drawn hangings. These stirred
gently as though moved by a breeze.</p>

<p>&#8220;A window is open,&#8221; said Scanlon, mentally.
&#8220;And some one is sitting by it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He remained motionless in the shadow and
watched. Yes; some one was there. A moment
or two told him more.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure those are the folds of a white gown,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
he told himself. &#8220;The golden Helen is in the
alcove. But what&#8217;s the idea?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Mr. Scanlon was quite sure of one thing.
And that was that no one would seek this unusual
place and at such an hour without some
purpose. He fancied he caught a glint of a
polished surface at those points where the dim
light caught it; then he became aware of a curious
shape which he could not altogether make out.
Cautiously he shortened the distance between
himself and the alcove. And now he saw something
else. Between him and the patch of sky
which showed through the window was a series
of perpendicular bars&mdash;very fine, and very close
together. As he followed these up and down he
gradually began to sense the shape of the other
thing which had puzzled him. Then like a flash
he got it all. The thing was a harp&mdash;a gilt harp&mdash;upon
which the faint light was glancing, and the
fine bars between him and the sky were its strings.</p>

<p>Motionless, Bat stood and looked. The harp!
Well, and then what? Firmly fixed in the back
of his mind for some days was the idea that he&#8217;d
hear more of the harp before the matter in hand
was done.</p>

<p>&#8220;And not in a musical way, either,&#8221; was his
thought. &#8220;That instrument means something
else, and I&#8217;ll gamble that, when it comes out, it&#8217;ll
be something of interest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he stood watching. He had a feeling of
movement behind the hangings; to be sure the
breeze stirred them now and then; but it was not
that.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the girl,&#8221; he said, mentally. &#8220;And she&#8217;s
putting something over. But what?&#8221;</p>

<p>Across the strings of the harp stole a shadowy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
hand. Bat listened for a sound, but none came.
Again came the hand, and still again, but no
sound followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s playing,&#8221; he told himself. &#8220;Playing,
and yet the strings are silent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amazed, he stood and watched the shadowy
flitting, but the strings were still mute. And
then, somehow, there came to the watcher&#8217;s mind
the scene on the moonlit hilltop the night before
when the invalid sat mutely in his chair and
gazed at Schwartzberg.</p>

<p>And with this Mr. Scanlon gave it up. As
softly as he had come, just so softly did he go;
and when he reached his own room, he said,
bewilderedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is what comes of breaking a resolution!
I said I&#8217;d not try to reason out any more of these
things, but I broke the vow and am punished.
But here, on this spot, I renew it. Come what
will, or go what may, I&#8217;m finished!&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that Mr. Scanlon went to bed.</p>

<small>DEALS MAINLY WITH SOME NEWS FROM
MEXICO</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE next day at Schwartzberg was uneventful.
Scanlon saw very little of Campe, and
nothing at all of either of the ladies.
Kretz was silent and in no way interesting.</p>

<p>Once, about the middle of the afternoon, Bat
took a walk along the river bank, but he saw
nothing which caught his attention, and he did
not go far. The remainder of the day he lounged
about, smoking and reading. The day following
was even more dull; except for a gallop in the
morning with Campe on a pair of well-conditioned
horses, the time was altogether unprofitable.
Then two more days passed, one duller than the
other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even some light reasoning would be
welcome,&#8221; complained the big man, &#8220;but there&#8217;s
nothing new to reason about.&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon the fifth day, having seen nothing of the
crime specialist, Scanlon made up his mind to
pay a casual visit to the inn.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that he&#8217;s just curling
up for a sight of me. And there may be important
news to pass on.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he got no sight of the jaundiced man at
the hostelry; indeed, there was no one in view
but the round bodied landlord, who laughed at
Mr. Scanlon&#8217;s jokes and was as affable as ever.</p>

<p>Bat tramped back to Schwartzberg in a
thoughtful mood.</p>

<p>&#8220;A dead calm,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Complete and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
absolute. And not a sail in sight. But,&#8221; with a
lift of the eyebrows, &#8220;maybe it&#8217;s that thing I&#8217;ve
so often heard of&mdash;the calm before the storm.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the middle of the afternoon the bell at the
gate rang, and a little later Kretz came in with a
telegram.</p>

<p>&#8220;For Mr. Scanlon,&#8221; said the German.</p>

<p>The big man tore open the envelope. As he
expected, it was from Ashton-Kirk, and read:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;See me in the city at nine o&#8217;clock to-night.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything important?&#8221; asked Campe who was
watching him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m called to the city,&#8221; replied Bat. He
glanced at a time-table, and added: &#8220;However,
I&#8217;ll not leave until after dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Back to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More than likely.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the time that had passed since his talk
with Scanlon as to the danger which threatened
him, Campe had not once recurred to the subject.
But that he bore it well in mind Scanlon was
confident.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s thinking it over,&#8221; the big man had
concluded. &#8220;He&#8217;ll come to it when he&#8217;s ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the telegram from the special detective was
almost an assurance that Fuller&#8217;s report had been
received; and if this were so, Ashton-Kirk would,
in all probability, soon be ready to take some
step, no matter what Campe&#8217;s attitude.</p>

<p>At seven-thirty Scanlon entered a train, and an
hour later he was in the city; a taxi took him to
Ashton-Kirk&#8217;s door, and Stumph showed him at
once to his friend&#8217;s study.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk, as he shook
Scanlon, smilingly, by the hand, &#8220;and how did
you leave every one at Schwartzberg?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m fine,&#8221; said Bat. &#8220;But there&#8217;s not much
stirring at the castle. After one mad outburst of
enthusiasm, everything seems to have come to a
stand.&#8221;</p>

<p>The crime specialist nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;The besieging army has not been very active,
then,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I rather expected that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d know more about the folks at the inn
than I would,&#8221; said Bat. &#8220;I went over there yesterday
for the first time in days. But no one was
around. When did you leave?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had taken the hints the landlord and help
gave me,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk, grimly, &#8220;I&#8217;d have
left the first day. I understand the statement of
the other hotel keeper very well now; you know
he told me that new guests never stayed long at
the inn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t want you, eh?&#8221; Scanlon chuckled.
&#8220;Well, what could they do with a perfect stranger
around, and all of them up to their ears in important
private business?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But for once, anyhow, they failed,&#8221; said the
special detective. &#8220;I needed a certain length of
time to collect what facts I was after, and that
time I was bound to stay. They did everything
short to burn the place about my ears, but I
ignored their efforts and talked about my liver.
I got all the information I wanted by last night,
and as Burgess wired me that Fuller&#8217;s report had
arrived, I left this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I sort of thought you&#8217;d had word from
Mexico,&#8221; said Bat. &#8220;But before you tell me
what it is, maybe I&#8217;d better unload my further
experiences as Schwartzberg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; agreed the other, quietly.</p>

<p>Thereupon the big man proceeded to relate all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
that had befallen him since seeing the crime
specialist upon the river bank in the guise of a
jaundiced man. Ashton-Kirk listened with
interest and with narrowed eyes, and when the
other had finished, he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the most curious things in all this
business of investigation,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is the way
things have of falling together. At times this is
not only bizarre, but also astounding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Knowles seems to be a fairly industrious
lady, doesn&#8217;t she?&#8221; said Bat. &#8220;Early and late
she&#8217;s on the job. I couldn&#8217;t get anything out of
the business with the harp, though I&#8217;m sure she
has a pretty well fixed purpose; but the little
game of the sword was plain enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective made no reply, but took a cigarette
from a box upon the table, lighted it and
began pacing the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not easy to believe that a woman with a
face like Miss Knowles could put together a little
job like that, though,&#8221; said Scanlon, also lighting
a cigarette. &#8220;If I hadn&#8217;t seen the thing working
itself out, I wouldn&#8217;t have believed it. And it
took some nerve, after she failed once, to get him
out there among the hills so that she could take
another swipe at him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk nodded and went on with his
smoking and his pacing.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Bat, inquiringly, &#8220;why the sword?
If she is leagued with these people to do away
with Campe, why isn&#8217;t it enough to do it in the
readiest way? Why must it be done with the big
blade from the tapestry room?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the other&#8217;s mind seemed to be moving in
another channel.</p>

<p>&#8220;This parcel,&#8221; said he, &#8220;which you saw delivered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
and which Miss Knowles at once took charge
of&mdash;you are quite sure it contained only blank
paper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see it opened,&#8221; replied Bat. &#8220;But I
saw it repacked, and that&#8217;s all that went back into
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk smiled in a dreamy sort of way;
the smoke wreathed above his head and his eyes
were half closed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you notice,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;how the package
was wrapped?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just heavy manilla paper,&#8221; said Bat, &#8220;and
tied with a kind of a mixed coloured string.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dreamy smile deepened; the face of Ashton-Kirk
grew out of the smoke wreaths like a
nodding Buddha, so utterly peaceful was it.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very interesting,&#8221; said he, in a pleased
tone. &#8220;This little matter of yours shows more
and more quality with every step.&#8221; He paced up
and down the floor, still smoking and still with
the smile upon his face. &#8220;And it was after the
receipt of this parcel that the sword was missed
from its place upon the wall?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was,&#8221; answered Bat, staring. &#8220;But look
here! You seem to be connecting these two
things; for my part, I can&#8217;t see them even near to
each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow, perhaps,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk,
&#8220;we&#8217;ll take a few moments to explain things.
Just now, however, there is work to do of a more
serious nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went to a cabinet and opening a drawer took
out some typed sheets.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fuller telegraphed his report in a private
cipher,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and this is the translation.
He was rather fortunate in the matter, for one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
his first queries put him upon the track of exactly
the people he was after&mdash;those who knew young
Campe&#8217;s father both privately and as a business
man, who were Americans and were willing to
talk. Within twenty-four hours he had these
facts,&#8221; tapping the sheets, &#8220;on the wire.&#8221;</p>

<p>He then read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The Campes in Mexico seem to have been
a family that held the respect and good will of
the community. Their business dealings were
always carried on on a high plane, and they
were personally affable and easily approached.
For years success marked all their ventures;
their undertakings brought rich returns and
seemed constantly increasing.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The house was seldom for very long out of
the public eye. However, about five years
ago, there came a lull in their doings. Their
ventures were few; and in the completion of
some large contracts they were known to have
borrowed money.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;This lull continued for about the space of a
year, and seemed to grow more and more pronounced.
The public was unaware of anything
wrong, but those on the inside knew that the
Campes had lost a very great deal of money;
and as time passed it was a question as to
whether they would recover or no.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But, suddenly, recover they did, and
brilliantly. Some of their copper holdings
developed amazingly, and in a short time they
were going along at their usual winning pace,
just as though nothing had ever happened.
During this commercial halt, if I may so call it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
I find there was also a sort of social one. And
as you asked me to pay special attention to the
friends of the head of the house, I looked into
their social sagging with a good deal of interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;In its efforts to regain its financial footing
during the time of depression, the house of
Campe dealt with people with whom it would
have hesitated to associate itself in days more
flush. Also it made acquaintances, possibly
through these dealings, with people who were
entirely unknown in those circles in which the
family had always moved. One of these in
particular was a man named Alva, who had
once been a professor of physics at Chapultepec.
He was, I understand, a peculiar sort of person,
a cripple, who made a boast of his Indian ancestry.
Alva bore a bad reputation, and was
considered wonderfully clever in many ways.
There was another of these new-made friends&mdash;an
American&mdash;named Evans, a fat, smooth
individual&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Scanlon, in recognition,
&#8220;do I once more meet my friend of the
covered bridge?&#8221;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;&#8216;This American,&#8217;&#8221; continued Ashton-Kirk,
his eyes still upon the sheets, &#8220;&#8216;is known to
have been in various sorts of trouble in Honduras
and Guatemala; but just what these
offences were I have not been able to learn.
However, the Guatemalan Minister of Police
of the period in which these things took place
is now that country&#8217;s Minister at Washington;
something might be learned from him. During
the period of the Campe family&#8217;s depression,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
Frederic Campe, father to the Frederic now in
the United States, was quite intimate with
both Alva and Evans. They were received frequently
at his house and, apparently, highly
esteemed. But when the financial turn came,
this intimacy grew less apparent; finally it
ceased altogether. It was probably a year
after this that Frederic Campe met his death on
board his yacht.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>The special detective laid the sheets upon the
table, and looked at Scanlon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;what do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To me,&#8221; replied that gentleman, &#8220;it looks as
though you&#8217;d hit the thing fair on the point that
last day I was here. Some kind of an understanding
was had with this man Alva and the
other fellow, Evans. But the elder Campe broke
it off after he got flush again; they hung on and
kept insisting on his doing whatever it was that
he&#8217;d promised to do. He refused, and they finally
got him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said he. &#8220;My theory as to what
might possibly have happened and Fuller&#8217;s report
you&#8217;ve put together very well indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; ventured Scanlon, &#8220;though it might
be clever enough, this guessing at things won&#8217;t
get us anything unless we carry it further.&#8221; He
looked at the crime specialist inquiringly. &#8220;What
do you think we&#8217;d better do next?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk pressed one of the series of call
bells, then he lighted another cigarette.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to have just a little more information
about this man Alva,&#8221; said he. &#8220;He interests
me immensely. Atavism is one of the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
curious and fascinating things in the world,&#8221; he
continued, as he rested against one corner of the
table, his singular eyes upon the big man. &#8220;One
never knows when to expect it, and it sometimes
takes the most peculiar of forms. A strain of
blood, a physical peculiarity will suddenly appear
after an absence of generations, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here there came a knock upon the door, and a
small compactly built man entered the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Burgess,&#8221; spoke the crime specialist, &#8220;early
in the morning go down to Parker&#8217;s and borrow a
surveying outfit&mdash;a complete one&mdash;tell him not to
miss anything, and also to tell you how they&#8217;re
used.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough to go through the motions?&#8221; said
the compact man with a grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. Then take O&#8217;Neil and go out on the
first train you can get to Marlowe Furnace. Find
a place called Schwartzberg up along the river on
the west bank, and about a mile above the station.
Make that the centre of your movements for the
day; don&#8217;t get out of hearing of the usual signal,
and when you do hear it make for the house at
once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Burgess nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And all the time we are
hanging around we&#8217;ll be busy laying off the land
with the surveyor&#8217;s stuff, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Ashton-Kirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything else?&#8221; asked the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>Burgess nodded and took his departure.</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk, in spite of the fact that he had
talked freely upon certain points of the case with
Scanlon, had said little or nothing as to his movements
in the immediate future.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>Nevertheless there was something in the air of
the study which seemed to promise action&mdash;sharp,
light-producing action&mdash;and the big man was
pleased.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to be getting ready for a little something,&#8221;
spoke Mr. Scanlon.</p>

<p>The other smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow, more than likely, will be a busy
day,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and it&#8217;s always best to prepare
for such a little ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you expect to happen?&#8221; asked Mr.
Scanlon, curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything. But one thing will almost surely
take place. And that is: the Campe matter will
be solved for good and all.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />


<small>IN WHICH ASHTON-KIRK PAYS HIS SECOND VISIT
TO SCHWARTZBERG</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SCANLON was not at all an impatient man,
but the length of time consumed by Ashton-Kirk
next morning over his toilet and
his breakfast rather put him on edge.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like to see a man fussy about his appearance,&#8221;
said he to himself. &#8220;It&#8217;s a sign that he&#8217;s
in health. Breakfast is also a good sign. The
fellow that can cheerfully face his morning meal is
usually all right inside. But both things can be
carried to extremes. When there&#8217;s pressing matters
to be carried through what matter how you
look; when a puzzle of weeks&#8217; standing is about
to turn over on its edge and give a last kick, a
chop, an egg and a roll shouldn&#8217;t be the things to
interfere with its doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>But though the big man was in a highly excited
state, Ashton-Kirk was as calm as an August
afternoon. He smoked a good-sized cigar after
breakfast and read the newspapers. To the
amazement of Mr. Scanlon he even showed interest
in such things as the tariff, the building of a new
cup defender, and the international aspect of
canal tolls.</p>

<p>However, at about ten o&#8217;clock a long telegram
came; when he read this his inactivity ceased;
at once he rang for his car, and when it arrived
he and the big man got in. It was a brisk, sunny
November day, and they sped through the city
streets and finally into the country roads with
that smoothness and ease possible to the modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
automobile. They flashed by the little station at
Marlowe Furnace and across the covered bridge;
then, as they climbed the first hill on the west
bank they sighted the towers of Schwartzberg.</p>

<p>&#8220;And also two very industrious surveyors,&#8221;
said Ashton-Kirk, his keen eye picking out two
small figures in the distance, who appeared deeply
absorbed in the measuring of some land.</p>

<p>Mr. Scanlon was pleased with the whole idea,
and said so.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that we&#8217;ll need a little
help. And this is about as good a way to have a
couple of willing lads hanging around as a fellow
could think of.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sergeant-Major Kretz was upon the wall; when
the car drew up at the gate he scrambled down
inside. A moment or two later the gate was
opened, and Campe, much surprised, made his
appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Back again,&#8221; said the big man, cheerfully,
as he got out, followed by the investigator.
&#8220;Everything all right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything,&#8221; replied the young man. He
shook hands with Ashton-Kirk, and added:
&#8220;I&#8217;m very glad to see you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scanlon looked about. There was no one
within ear-shot, so he remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t say anything further about that
matter we talked about the other night, so I
thought I&#8217;d help you make up your mind by
bringing my friend to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>If he expected young Campe to show surprise
at hearing that Ashton-Kirk was the person
mentioned in that conversation, Scanlon was
disappointed. The young man merely said,
quietly:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>&#8220;It was rather a difficult thing to solve for
myself. I&#8217;m glad that you&#8217;ve done it for me.&#8221;
Then addressing the special detective, he added:
&#8220;Will you come in?&#8221;</p>

<p>The car was driven into the courtyard; then
the two men followed Campe into the house.
When they had seated themselves at a table in
one corner of the trophy-hung room, Ashton-Kirk
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is always more or less presumptuous to
interfere in the private affairs of another. However,
there are times, and all persons of experience
have encountered them, when this does not hold
good. A man occasionally gets into such deep
water that he is helpless; at the same time there
may be reasons, as I understand there are in your
case, which may prevent his asking for help.&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Campe regarded the speaker attentively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>The long fingers of Ashton-Kirk pattered upon
the edge of the table; he met the gaze of the
other with steady eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;In such cases,&#8221; said he, &#8220;comparison usually
figures very strongly. Some danger threatens a
man. But he fears to appeal for help. Why?
Because the thing which threatens is as nothing
compared with another thing which a call for help
might expose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scanlon saw the peaked face of young Campe
twitch, but the intent look never left his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What more?&#8221; asked he.</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet it may be,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk,
&#8220;that this hidden thing may be none of the
endangered person&#8217;s doing. A demand may be
made upon him by those threatening him, which
he may be unable to meet.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said the young man again, and
Scanlon noticed that his voice trembled a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; said the crime specialist, &#8220;a
wealthy family fell into hard days. Suppose the
head of that family, in a moment of weakness,
allowed himself to be approached by&mdash;well, we&#8217;ll
say&mdash;a criminal organization. Let us further
suppose that after he had gone into a shady
matter pretty deeply, his position suddenly and
legitimately mended, and in consequence he
washed his hands of all crooked dealing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said young Campe, and his face was
pale as death.</p>

<p>&#8220;Again let us suppose,&#8221; continued Ashton-Kirk,
calmly, &#8220;that in so leaving the councils of
the criminals he took with him something vitally
necessary to their success. They demanded it of
him; he refused; and, to still further suppose,
we&#8217;ll say that one morning a yacht called the
<i>Conquistador</i> was blown into&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the young master of Schwartzberg came
to his feet; his eyes gleamed like those of an
insane person, and his voice was husky and broken.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you know?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; replied Ashton-Kirk, quietly, &#8220;I
have a fair idea as to what <i>has</i> happened in
Mexico, and what <i>is</i> happening here. And if you
care to have me proceed in the matter, and will
lend me what assistance I need, there is a good
chance that by this time to-morrow you will have
left all your fears and worries behind you.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment the young man sat staring; then
he reached forward one shaking hand and laid it
upon the speaker&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; said he, &#8220;if you can do that, you will
have saved me from death or from the madhouse.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>Ashton-Kirk placed his hand upon that of
Campe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Consider it done then,&#8221; said he quietly.
&#8220;Scanlon has told you, perhaps, that I have some
small talent in matters of this sort. And I
think,&#8221; nodding and smiling, &#8220;I see a fairly open
field before me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat looked impressively at the master of the
castle.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s had this thing cooking only since the
day I first brought him here,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But
he&#8217;s got a fire under it as hot as a lower berth in
Hades. And so if he says he&#8217;ll serve it to-day, all
done, believe him. For he&#8217;s just the kind of a
fellow to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Ashton-Kirk&#8217;s first visit here was not all
chance then,&#8221; said Campe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not quite,&#8221; returned Bat, unblushingly.
&#8220;You see, along about the time of that visit I
had got it fixed fast in my mind that everything
was not just what it ought to be around here; and
as I didn&#8217;t think myself man enough for the job,
I took a day off and got Kirk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Campe. &#8220;I felt all along
that something of the sort would be the best thing
I could do, but I never quite got up the courage
to take the step. If there had been myself only
to think of,&#8221; and his glance went from the big
man to Ashton-Kirk, &#8220;I might have done it.
But there was some one else, and that is what
stopped me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, however, that the time for action seemed
to have arrived, there was a stain of colour in his
cheeks, his hand grew steadier, and a look of
purpose came into his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You spoke of my giving you assistance,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
he to the crime specialist. &#8220;Give it a name; I
am ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk, satisfaction in his
voice. &#8220;Then we&#8217;ll begin at once.&#8221; He went to
a window and looked out into the courtyard where
the warm sun flooded the stones. &#8220;It&#8217;s a beautiful
day,&#8221; said he. Then: &#8220;You have no car
here, Mr. Campe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we have no use for one, as we seldom go
any distance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A run will be a novelty. Take my car. Also
my driver, and both Miss Knowles and your
aunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Campe looked at him questioningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I went over the house some days ago,&#8221; said
Ashton-Kirk, calmly, meeting the look, &#8220;and I
should like to go over it again&mdash;in my own way.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a little space of silence; once Scanlon
thought the young man was about to refuse.
But when he spoke, &#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;As the country round about is a fine one, and
you have not done it before, don&#8217;t be in a hurry
to return,&#8221; spoke the special detective. &#8220;Take
plenty of time. And say nothing to the ladies as
to why I am here. We don&#8217;t want to startle
them, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will say nothing,&#8221; said young Campe, and
then he left the room.</p>

<p>The next half hour was spent by Ashton-Kirk
in smoking and talking with Scanlon upon almost
every other subject than the matter in hand.
Then Campe returned, and with him were Miss
Hohenlo and Miss Knowles.</p>

<p>The former was all on a flutter, but the younger
woman, so Scanlon noticed, was eager-eyed and
watchful.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>&#8220;She knows that something&#8217;s doing,&#8221; observed
Bat to himself. &#8220;And she&#8217;s wondering just what
it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so very kind of you, Mr. Ashton-Kirk, to
come again so soon,&#8221; said Miss Hohenlo, girlishly.
&#8220;It will do Frederic such a great deal of good to
get his mind into some fresh matters. He&#8217;s
been so very downcast of late; and I&#8217;m quite
sure that interesting himself in Count Hohenlo&#8217;s
life and times will benefit him greatly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s so kind of you to put your car at our
service,&#8221; said Miss Knowles. &#8220;We go out so
little since we came to Schwartzberg. Frederic
came swooping into the room just now with the
news, and we were as delighted as children.&#8221;
Her eyes went to Scanlon, and then back to the
crime specialist. &#8220;But,&#8221; she suggested, &#8220;won&#8217;t
you find it very dull here while we are gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite the contrary,&#8221; replied Ashton-Kirk.
&#8220;There are many things in which I can interest
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are some of the Count&#8217;s journals in the
library,&#8221; said Miss Hohenlo. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t overlook
them. His views upon his time are quite
charming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite,&#8221; said the tall Miss Knowles. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
read one or two of them&mdash;charming, leisurely
things, in the most beautiful handwriting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Count knew so many wonderful people,&#8221;
said Miss Hohenlo. &#8220;His anecdotes of them are
so striking and so characteristic. It was a day
when personal quality told in one&#8217;s favour.
Nowadays people are so hopelessly alike.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk smiled. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think they
only appear to be so?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>But Miss Hohenlo shook her head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I am quite sure that as time
goes on, people grow more and more alike. We
live in such crowds, you see, there is very little
opportunity for us to be different.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the Count&#8217;s day, dress had so much to do
with the impression one made,&#8221; said the special
detective. &#8220;Many a man has won fame by
introducing a new periwig, or had himself talked
about in the coffee houses for months because of
an elaboration of the buckles of his shoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the car containing the two women and
young Campe rolled through the gateway and
the gate closed behind them, Scanlon looked at
Ashton-Kirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;where do we begin?&#8221;</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />


<small>TELLS HOW ASHTON-KIRK POINTED OUT
CERTAIN MATTERS OF INTEREST</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS Ashton-Kirk was about to reply to his
friend&#8217;s question, the door opened and
Kretz came into the room. He saluted
stiffly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Herr Campe,&#8221; said he, &#8220;told me to come to
you. He said you would speak to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he say anything more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He told me to obey your orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Well, sergeant, I have a
bit of work to do about the castle, and Mr. Scanlon
is to be my guide.&#8221;</p>

<p>With not a vestige of expression upon his
granite-like face, the sergeant-major again saluted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; went on Ashton-Kirk, &#8220;I expect to be
engaged for an hour or more. Keep watch at
the gate, if any one approaches&mdash;any one, mind
you&mdash;report to me before you admit him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kretz nodded stiffly and departed; and then
Ashton-Kirk turned to Scanlon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are your nails still in the door to the vaults?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are,&#8221; replied Scanlon, proudly. &#8220;Up
to their heads, and holding like grim death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get a tool of some sort. We&#8217;ll have to draw
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a claw hammer Scanlon pulled the nails
without much difficulty. Then the two descended
into the regions below. Ashton-Kirk carried an
electric torch, which shot a small, searching
column of light ahead through the gloom.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>&#8220;It beats a lamp or a lantern,&#8221; said Bat, his
mind going back to the morning upon which their
visit to the cellars was greeted with a volley of
shots. &#8220;If there are any volatile parties hanging
around, they can&#8217;t get such a fair slam at us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rays of the torch danced along the floor,
the ceiling, the walls and into corners. Satisfied
that there were no prowlers in the vaults, the
light ceased its erratic flashing; it now became
intent, and fixed itself upon some small spaces for
quite long periods of time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Again the floor seems to attract him,&#8221; thought
the big man. &#8220;Footprints and such.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the crime specialist seemed annoyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been a great deal of tramping up
and down by all of us,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Quite a
number of very definite impressions are to be
found in the dust, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he stopped suddenly,
the beam of light held to a place in the floor,
fixedly, and his breath drew in with a sharpness
that told of a discovery.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Bat, anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221;</p>

<p>The crime specialist pointed to what appeared
to be a long streak in the dust upon the vault
floor. It was broken here and there by footmarks,
but seemed to continue for some distance
outside the radius of the light.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see it,&#8221; said Bat, mildly. &#8220;But what is
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is another just like it,&#8221; spoke Ashton-Kirk,
&#8220;and running the same way. And there is
still another, but not so heavy, between the other
two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sure enough, as Bat looked, he saw two deeply
marked streaks, with a third not so pronounced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
between them; they held their relative positions
and ran away in the same direction as far as his
eye could follow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I get the three of them,&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon.
&#8220;And once again I ask for the answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks,&#8221; and the glow of the torch began to
follow the course of the lines, &#8220;as though our
friend Alva, from the inn, had been here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s got through,&#8221; said Bat, tapping his head
dolefully. &#8220;It&#8217;s got through at last. These
marks were made by the wheels of his chair&mdash;two
big ones outside, and one small one in the middle.&#8221;
There was a silence as the eyes of the big man
followed the spreading rays of the torch. &#8220;Alva,
you know, promised to drop in some time,&#8221;
continued Bat. &#8220;And I can see that he&#8217;s a man
of his word.&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective followed the wheel marks; they
led directly across the vault to the east wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right slam into it,&#8221; spoke Mr. Scanlon from
the darkness of a half dozen yards away. &#8220;Looks
like they had an accident on the line.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ashton-Kirk did not hear; he was too
intent upon what was before him. Up the wall
crept the shaft of light, and about four feet above
the floor it rested upon a heavy iron ring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; said Scanlon, approaching and staring
at the ring with interest. &#8220;Was it here that
they chained the unhappy captive in the days of
old?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk examined the ring keenly; then
the rays of the torch flashed over the wall, all
about it. As it approached the floor once more
he suddenly exclaimed: &#8220;Ah!&#8221; And down he
went on his knees in the dust.</p>

<p>Scanlon, bending forward, saw a place at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
edge of a great block of stone where a thick,
greenish fluid had apparently oozed through.</p>

<p>&#8220;From the river, I guess,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re
pretty close to it, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk touched the fluid with a finger
tip; then he held out his hand toward his friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the odour at all familiar?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Scanlon sniffed, gingerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;By George!&#8221; exclaimed he. &#8220;Crude oil.&#8221;
He stared at the other. &#8220;What&#8217;s it doing here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk arose to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take hold of the ring,&#8221; directed he. Bat did
so. &#8220;Now pull.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Scanlon put his weight to the pull, he felt
something give; to his astonishment the whole
mass of stone before him turned smoothly upon
an invisible pivot; before him was a dark opening
bricked, and extending apparently for a long
distance underground. For a moment or two
Bat was too dumbfounded to speak, but at length
he thrust his hands deep into his pocket and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve read about them, and I&#8217;ve heard
about them, but this is the first I ever saw.&#8221; The
torch lighted up the passage for some distance,
and as the big man peered into it, he went on:
&#8220;It&#8217;s all properly mouldy, and it&#8217;s got the water
trickling between the bricks, the damp patches
and the fungus, just as Sylvanus Cobb and the
others used to write about.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, underneath the astonishment, his mind
had apparently been moving, for he went on in
another tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;The crude oil was put on the working parts
by the fellows at the inn when they found that
the stone didn&#8217;t move smoothly. And now,&#8221;
turning upon Ashton-Kirk, &#8220;I am wise to all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
interest that&#8217;s been taken in the river bank of late.
This passage opens somewhere on the bank, and I
was the only one that didn&#8217;t know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ashton-Kirk shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t <i>know</i> it,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But I <i>did</i> suspect.
The fact that certain persons gained entrance
to the cellar whenever they felt disposed
to do so pointed very strongly to the existence of
just such a passage as this. That it did not appear
in the plan of the castle of which Kretz spoke
meant nothing; such things are never shown in
plans. My attention was attracted toward the
river bank as a possible place for the passage&#8217;s
outlet, because Schwartzberg is near the bank,
and it has always been a custom to have such
secret ways lead down to the brinks of rivers
wherever possible. A river, I suppose, suggested
a way of escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the crime specialist ceased speaking, he
entered the passage, and Scanlon followed. It
was almost circular in shape, and the big man
could walk without bending his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fortunately for the builder, the stone through
which the cut was made was soft, as I showed you
the other day,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk. &#8220;If it had
been good solid granite, I think Schwartzberg
would have been left without its secret way.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the far end of the tunnel daylight filtered in
between some faded tangled growth. A heap of
stones, cement clinging to them, lay in the way.</p>

<p>&#8220;The tunnel was sealed,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk,
&#8220;and when the criminals laid siege to the castle
they broke it open.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat Scanlon protruded his head; in a few
moments he drew it back.</p>

<p>&#8220;No wonder no one ever got wise to this,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
he. &#8220;It opens right under that big rock that
hangs over the water; and the water runs directly
underneath. They must have had some little
time getting the man of the chair in, unless they
have a boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>After they had looked about interestedly for a
while, they left the tunnel, and closed the massive
stone door. Ashton-Kirk then picked up the
wheel tracks with the torch rays, and this time he
followed them in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trying to find out what the crippled party
was up to,&#8221; Bat told himself. &#8220;Well, it must
have been something important, seeing as he went
to such a lot of trouble to get here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here and there went the special detective, his
keen eyes following the wheel marks. Alva, so it
seemed, had been rolled to all parts of the vaults,
and the track was, to Scanlon&#8217;s notion, hopelessly
tangled. But Ashton-Kirk seemed to see much
that was interesting and of consequence; at
length, however, he straightened up, stretched
the tightness which the stooping posture had produced
out of his back and shoulders, and smiled at
his companion in a way that spoke of much
satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our friends were here quite recently,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;In fact, I will venture to say that they were here
last night, and, perhaps, upon each of the preceding
nights. All the indications speak of acute
interest&mdash;and failure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Failure!&#8221; said Scanlon. &#8220;In what?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk smiled once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;In what they came for,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And&mdash;having
failed&mdash;they will come again.&#8221;</p>

<p>His interest in the vaults seemed to have exhausted
itself; and so he ascended to the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
floor with Bat at his heels. After making the
door fast, the big man asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, where do we give the next look? In
the room where the tapestries are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! You have not forgotten the tapestries!&#8221;
The crime specialist&#8217;s eyes snapped. &#8220;I never
saw finer. Campe has a prize in them, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The tapestries are fine&mdash;for those folks who
are strong for them,&#8221; admitted Bat. &#8220;But there
are other things in that room that would get me
quicker than they would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As your interest is so keen,&#8221; smiled Ashton-Kirk,
&#8220;we may as well take the tapestry room
first. Who knows what interests we may uncover
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>Scanlon led the way upstairs and pushed open
the door of the room in question. The sun shone
in; the painting, the carvings, the tapestry, the
rare rugs and furniture showed to wonderful
advantage.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got it a step or two ahead of me,&#8221;
admitted Mr. Scanlon, &#8220;but for all that, I&#8217;ll say
it&#8217;s some room. Class from every angle.&#8221;</p>

<p>The harp stood, muffled, near a window, and
the big man was gratified to see Ashton-Kirk go
directly to it and strip off the cover.</p>

<p>&#8220;The harp,&#8221; said Bat, &#8220;is an emblem of Erin,
and I have nothing against it. But there is something
about this particular one that I don&#8217;t like,
for every time I look at it I feel it&#8217;s got something
on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk examined the instrument with
much attention; there was a pleased look upon his
face; his singular eyes shone with interest; and
now and then he uttered a low exclamation. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
fingers ran over the strings. Then, at length, he
stepped back and stood nodding and smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is exceedingly clever. As a
matter of fact I don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;ve encountered
anything more ingenious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; said Scanlon, blankly.</p>

<p>But the crime specialist did not seem to hear
him, and then, before Bat could ask a question, he
had turned away and was glancing interestedly
about the room once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the sword,&#8221; said Bat, desirous that
this important feature in the doings about
Schwartzberg should not be overlooked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes.&#8221; The other nodded and glanced at
the huge weapon with appraising eyes. &#8220;A very
powerful arm. The Hohenlo who carried it at
Milan was a person capable of giving good service,
no doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>But after one glance the speaker turned away;
evidently it was not the sword he was looking for.
His keen eyes, wandering about, went from object
to object; then a small, beautifully fashioned
desk caught his glance, and he went to it. First
one drawer and then another was opened; they
held stationery, letters apparently awaiting
answers, small bills and other matters. At length
Bat, who was absorbed in watching the turning
out of the desk, gave an exclamation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said he. &#8220;There we are.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pointed to some neatly tied packets in the
bottom of a drawer.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are the things&mdash;the rolls of blank paper
I saw Miss Knowles looking at in the storage
room,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk took up one of the packets and
untied it. Very carelessly, as Scanlon thought, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
ran over the sheets; then he tossed them back
in the drawer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said the crime specialist, after a
moment, &#8220;that we have seen about all we want to
see for a space. Inside, that is. But outside there
may be one or two little matters which it would
be well to pick up.&#8221; He was about to turn away
from the desk; then pausing, he reopened one of
the drawers and took out a tangled mass of strings
which lay in the bottom of it. &#8220;Put these in
your pocket,&#8221; said he, handing them to Scanlon.
&#8220;We may need them to tie something together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reluctantly Bat left the house with him, and
glumly passed through the gate which Kretz held
open.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said he, to himself, &#8220;it&#8217;s not for
me to kick. But it does seem to me that the
place to get the good going over is the house.
And here we haven&#8217;t done any more than look at
a few corners of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was now considerably past noon; the sun
was warm and the brown hills, with here and there
a patch of vivid green, stretched away to the
south, the west and the north. To the east the
river slipped by smoothly, and toward the river
Ashton-Kirk turned his steps. He paused upon
an overhanging mass of rock and looked over its
edge.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s under this, I think, that we found the
opening to the secret way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Bat.</p>

<p>After studying the situation for a little, the
special detective moved on. He held to the river
banks for the better part of a mile; then he paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a moment,&#8221; said he to Scanlon. He left
the path and sprang down the bank; plunging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
into a tangle of shrivelled vines and small trees he
disappeared for a few moments, and when he
reappeared his face wore a satisfied look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, then,&#8221; said he, cheerfully, &#8220;we&#8217;ll take
a brisk little walk across country. And at the end
of it I may be able to show you something that
will surprise you.&#8221;</p>

<p>So away they went, up-hill and down-hill, and
Scanlon noted that their way was taking them in
the general direction of the inn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your life in the West,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk,
after a period of silence, &#8220;must have made you
acquainted with the various Indian tribes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A good many. I&#8217;ve eaten with Pawnees,
and hunted with Crows; I&#8217;ve broke horses with
the Cheyennes, when I was a youngster, and I&#8217;ve
fought the Sioux and the Apache. Another man
and I once put in a season with the Navajos; and
one time again, I had a party of Blackfeet chase
me through about a hundred miles of mountain,
with never a stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Navajos are an interesting tribe,&#8221; said the
crime specialist. &#8220;Their fabrics and their pottery
are picturesque and not without beauty of design
and form.&#8221; He was silent for another space, and
then asked: &#8220;You are not acquainted with any of
the tribes further south?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None across the border,&#8221; said Bat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mexico has some races of interesting savages.
Her hill people are hardy and independent, and
they&#8217;ve never been subdued.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of them,&#8221; replied Bat.</p>

<p>&#8220;But ancient Mexico possessed still more noteworthy
people. Humboldt, Vater and others who
have studied their remains have written very
interestingly of them. Auahuac was the ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
name of Mexico, and the first known race to
occupy the land was the Quinome.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some time ago!&#8221; remarked Mr. Scanlon, as
they strode along. &#8220;Before even friend
Columbus had a chance to hang up his name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Ashton-Kirk. &#8220;But just how
long the Quinomes remained it is not known, for
a number of wandering tribes seemed to have
entered afterward, paused and then took up their
way once more. Afterward the Toltecs came from
the west&mdash;later more tribes, to the number of
seven, one of whom was the Aztec.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of them,&#8221; said Scanlon. &#8220;Rather
queer looking old scouts; had heads flattened in
front, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; but he paused, his eyes going to
Ashton-Kirk in a curious look. Then he pursed
up his mouth, and began to whistle softly.</p>

<p>The crime specialist&#8217;s head was bent, and he
stabbed at the stubble and the brown weeds with
his stick; there was an expression upon his face
that told of one deep in speculation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Aztecs, as you suggest, were not a
physically beautiful people. And their civilisation
was as deformed as their persons.&#8221; There was a
halt as they breasted a hill; then he proceeded:
&#8220;It has come down as a sort of tradition that
Cortez, when he burned his ships, marched against
a people of mild nature and advanced culture.
Nothing could be more erroneous. They were a
savage race who had conquered their neighbours
by superior brutality; their intelligence was
inferior to the North American Indian of the same
time; it is true that they had a written language,
but their character was greatly inferior to that of
the Hindoos and other peoples.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A popular lecture,&#8221; was Mr. Scanlon&#8217;s mental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
observation. &#8220;But it seems to me it&#8217;s going to
land somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Aztecs made no roads,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk,
lifting his head and looking about as though
searching for a given spot; &#8220;and they had no
domestic animals. Both these things speak
strongly against them. But the most fearsome
thing about them was their religion.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused in a place between two small hills;
in the ground was a bowl-shaped hollow. Scanlon
looked at this and at the surroundings with interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some days ago I had occasion to speak to you
of the theory of Gall, the Antwerp empiric, as to
the skull and the brain and their effects, one upon
the other. It was the custom of the Aztecs to
flatten the heads of their children by continued
pressure; this resulted, finally, in the altering of
their skulls as a people. And who knows what
effect this deformity had upon their inclinations.
The horrors of their religious observances may,
perhaps, be traced to it altogether.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like as not,&#8221; admitted Mr. Scanlon.</p>

<p>The crime specialist kicked away some brush
which lay beside a log near by, and in this way
he disclosed a huge bundle of something like
parchment. With Scanlon&#8217;s help he unrolled it;
it was made up of a number of prepared sheepskins,
and to the edges ropes were attached.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; said Bat, as he looked at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose we were to throw this over the hollow
which you see here; then suppose we were to
draw it taut with the ropes after having passed
them around stakes&mdash;taut and tauter still until the
skins will stretch no more.&#8221; Ashton-Kirk looked
at the big man inquiringly. &#8220;What should we
have?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>&#8220;A drum!&#8221; cried Bat. &#8220;An immense drum!&#8221;
He returned the look of the other, adding, with
wonder: &#8220;And it&#8217;s a drum we&#8217;ve heard roaring
in the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew it was here,&#8221; said Scanlon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I came upon it after a little search one
day while prowling about in the guise of a man
with a disobedient liver.&#8221; He regarded the
drumhead in silence for a while, and then went
on:</p>

<p>&#8220;The Aztecs&#8217; places of worship were shaped like
pyramids, and were composed of terraces, one
above the other. Here their terrible war god,
Huitzilopochtli, was propitiated by human sacrifice.
A great drum was beaten, notifying all in
the city that an offering was to be made. The
pinioned victim was thrown face upward across
the sacrificial stone, which was green in colour
and with a humped up place which fitted into the
small of his back; with a blow of a great keen
blade his body was laid open.&#8221;</p>

<p>The breath caught in the big man&#8217;s throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; said he, his wide open eyes upon the
other&#8217;s face. &#8220;No!&#8221;</p>

<p>He continued to stare, and, slowly, what he had
just heard began to form in his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;The stone,&#8221; said he, &#8220;green, and with a hump
on it! The roaring of a great drum! A cut
down the front!&#8221; His hand closed upon Ashton-Kirk&#8217;s
arm. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen and heard things like
these, and I know a man with a flattened skull.
But what&#8217;s the answer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The greater part of the Mexican population is
mixed with Indian blood,&#8221; said the crime specialist.
&#8220;And one of the most curious studies I know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
of is the atavistic tendency&mdash;that is, the tendency
to recur to an ancestral type or deformity. A
thing may lie dormant in ten generations of men
or animals, and then suddenly assert itself in all
its fullness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think, then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Scanlon.</p>

<p>&#8220;That the man in the rolling chair, Alva, is a
&#8216;throwback&#8217;; that his deformed head is an
assertation of the old Aztec strain; that if this
deformity had anything to do with the fiendish
character of the Aztecs, it might naturally be
supposed that it has had some effect upon him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I get you,&#8221; said Bat Scanlon, slowly.
&#8220;Check me off, and see if I&#8217;m right. This fellow,
Alva, is the leader of the party at the inn. He&#8217;s
done for three of the Campe family already, and
is reaching for a fourth. The answer to this, so
you tell me, is that his Indian ancestors loved
blood spilling, and that the thing&#8217;s broke out in
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a part of the answer. It was only after
failing in something else, remember, that the
murder mania took possession of him. And
boasting of his Indian ancestry, as Fuller reports,
it is not at all strange that his murderous tendency
should find vent in the ancient form.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why all the frills? Why this?&#8221;
touching the drumhead with the toe of his shoe.
&#8220;Why the execution stone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All part of a system for terrorizing Campe.
And you&#8217;ve seen how it succeeded. They knew
he would understand; through fear of the death
which overtook his father, his uncle and his
brother, they hoped to bring him to some sort of
terms.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said the big man. He stood in silence
for a time, apparently digesting what he&#8217;d heard;
then he asked, curiously: &#8220;But how did you drop
to all this? How did you begin? How did you
work it out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My starting point,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk, &#8220;was
when you told me the landlord had had the inn
only a short time. I knew that if there was a
band working on the Campe affair they would
have headquarters in the neighbourhood; and
what you said looked promising.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why you wanted to go there before
you tried anything else,&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon.</p>

<p>The crime specialist nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I told you, the atmosphere of the inn
struck me unfavourably as soon as I had a chance
to feel it. I got the impression that there was an
understanding between the people we saw there;
and then it occurred to me that they were fakes;
with the exception of Alva there wasn&#8217;t a genuine
invalid in the lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man with the cough is a fairly lively
person,&#8221; said Bat.</p>

<p>&#8220;The idea of this,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk, &#8220;was
that as invalids they would escape attention; it
would form a reason for their being at the inn;
and so far as Marlowe Furnace and the country
round about is concerned, they were successful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Count me among the simpletons,&#8221; said Bat.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t fall until they fell on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You recall that we heard the voice of Alva
that night, off stage, so to speak, and lifted very
high. I at once felt that this was the voice of
authority, and I was curious to see him. The
Indian who pushed his chair first attracted my
attention when they came in. I knew he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
not a North American; this, and the fact that the
Campe trouble had its beginning in Mexico, must
have started my mind on its course. I had, also,
the rolling of the drum and the green stone stored
in the back of my memory; and when I saw the
peculiar indications of Alva&#8217;s skull I felt interested
enough to get a less obstructed look.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then your knocking those wrappings from
off his head wasn&#8217;t an accident after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little subterfuge,&#8221; smiled Ashton-Kirk.
&#8220;And a moment after seeing it I had the skull,
the rolling sound, the green stone and Mexico all
revolving in my mind. Before I slept that night
I had them associated. When I got you to leave
the road next morning and cut across country
toward the castle, it was because I saw the wheel
marks of Alva&#8217;s chair leave it at the same place;
and I was curious to see where he had gone the
night before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And this thing which made you send Fuller to
Mexico next day&mdash;how did you get that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a theory, built up around what I had
already seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the crime specialist looked at his watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; said he, surprised, &#8220;that it&#8217;s
three o&#8217;clock, and I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if the touring
party had returned.&#8221;</p>

<p>They turned and slowly began the tramp over
the hills toward Schwartzberg.</p>

<p>The afternoon sun lay warm and red on the
western slopes of the hills, and where it fell upon
the walls of the castle it had a peculiar effect.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even is broad day, Schwartzberg is no easy
place for me,&#8221; said Scanlon, his eyes upon the
grey pile.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is that?&#8221; asked the special detective.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>&#8220;It must be,&#8221; said the big man in reply, &#8220;that
the things that have happened in and about the
castle have so coloured my feelings towards it that
I can see it only in one way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A place of peril,&#8221; answered Scanlon, soberly.
&#8220;A place where danger is always waiting to reach
out its hand and give you something when you are
not expecting it. As you know, I&#8217;m not the kind
of a fellow to pick up impressions of this kind;
but Schwartzberg&#8217;s put its mark on me deep and
strong, and I can&#8217;t shake it off.&#8221;</p>

<small>SHOWS HOW THE GREAT SWORD SPOKE TO SCANLON</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BUT the automobile voyagers had not returned
when the two men reached Schwartzberg.</p>

<p>&#8220;Campe is taking plenty of time, as per request,&#8221;
observed Mr. Scanlon, as they settled
down to wait. &#8220;Unless,&#8221; and he looked at the
other, &#8220;you think something has happened to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ashton-Kirk shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Just at this time I think
Campe is perfectly safe from Alva and his crowd.
When you first came to me with the story I felt
that the matter was one of life and death&mdash;that it
would not wait an hour. But after studying
things hereabouts for a little I saw that in this I
had been mistaken. The criminals will not be
in a hurry to murder Campe. He is the last of his
family, and they want what he knows, or can give,
more than they want his life.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was fully five o&#8217;clock, and the dusk was
thickening when they heard the heavy braying of
the auto horn outside. A little later the two
ladies whisked past the library door, and then
Campe entered, dusty, and with an eager look.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have had a good run,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I kept them away as long as I could without
attracting their attention. But,&#8221; and the eager
look increased, &#8220;what news?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve looked around a bit,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk,
&#8220;both inside and outside; and we saw a
number of things which interested us greatly.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>Campe stood looking at the speaker for a moment;
then he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see that you are not ready to tell me the
result of your investigation. Very well. But
when the time comes,&#8221; and here his lips twitched
a little, &#8220;don&#8217;t delay.&#8221;</p>

<p>At dinner Miss Knowles was very lovely, and
the elder lady was flushed and animated.</p>

<p>&#8220;An automobile trip,&#8221; thought Bat, as he
listened to the spinster&#8217;s chatter &#8220;should be prescribed
for the good lady frequently. It&#8217;s done
her good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Baron Steuben received no more than his due
when Congress granted him lands and honours,&#8221;
she was saying to Ashton-Kirk. &#8220;But Count
Hohenlo was overlooked disgracefully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He had little popular or official recognition,&#8221;
replied the crime specialist. &#8220;But he lived in the
hearts of those who knew him, and they wrote
him down in their memories as a gallant soldier,
a true friend and a lover of freedom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Miss Hohenlo talked of the letters written
by the old hero; of the journals he had kept in
court and camp; of his plans and intentions; of
his adventures. Her eyes were no longer dull;
her plain face was full of spirit; her gestures, no
longer affected, were sharp and stirring. And
while she talked Miss Knowles was very quiet,
listening with attention. And, as she did so,
Mr. Scanlon watched her, speculatively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still on the lookout,&#8221; mused the big man,
&#8220;still with her eyes and ears open. I never saw
any one stick closer to a job than she does. But
what she hopes to get out of the talk of the maiden
lady I can&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>After dinner, as Miss Hohenlo was passing from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
the room, Scanlon saw Ashton-Kirk overtake Miss
Knowles as she was about to follow. The singular
eyes of the crime specialist were fixed upon her
face intently, and when he spoke his voice was so
low-pitched that none but the girl could hear.
But whatever it was he said, she turned pale and
Bat saw her hands tremble. Then without a
word of answer she cast a frightened look about
her and disappeared. Ashton-Kirk turned to
Campe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;d care for a game of billiards,&#8221;
said he. Then seeing the young man&#8217;s surprised
look, he added: &#8220;I&#8217;d be glad to join you myself,
but I think I&#8217;ll have my hands rather full of other
things. Your aunt would, I dare say, be delighted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Campe continued to look at the speaker for a
moment, then he said slowly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes, very likely she would. She&#8217;s very
clever with the cue, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later, as Ashton-Kirk and
Scanlon sat in the library, the big man patiently
awaiting the other&#8217;s pleasure, the click of the balls
began to come from the billiard room. Ashton-Kirk
stood up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said he, and Scanlon followed him into
the hall. Quietly they went until they reached
the door of the room where the tapestries hung.
Here they entered and found Miss Knowles, pale,
tall and with the frightened look still in her eyes,
standing in the middle of the floor.</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk closed the door gently, and
turning faced the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; thought Mr. Scanlon, &#8220;for a showdown.
Here is where the golden Helen is to be
brought up with a sharp turn.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>&#8220;Miss Knowles,&#8221; spoke the detective, quietly,
&#8220;may I ask just how long you have known what
I am?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I knew you&mdash;when I first saw your
face,&#8221; answered the girl in a low voice. &#8220;But I
did not place you. It was not until I had heard
your name that I knew you. You had been
pointed out to me once at a Departmental reception
at Washington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said the other. Then with a smile:
&#8220;You seem a trifle startled that day when you
recognized me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was,&#8221; replied the girl, &#8220;for your appearance
as Schwartzberg meant only one thing to me:
That all that I had suspected was true&mdash;that
Frederic was fearfully in danger&mdash;and that you
had been sent for to trace out his enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon, and Ashton-Kirk
glanced at him with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I rather thought it was something like that,&#8221;
said the latter gentleman. &#8220;But there are a
number of other questions I&#8217;d like to have you
answer, so that there will be no mistake as to
your position in the matter. Do you mind my
asking them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the night that you heard the thunderous
noise out among the hills, and Mr. Campe madly
rushed out to look for his tormentors, how did it
come that you stood beside him when he was discovered,
wounded?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl looked surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had followed&mdash;thinking to help him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How soon after?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A moment or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Ashton-Kirk looked at Scanlon.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>&#8220;Between the time you saw Campe without at
the gate, and the time you got downstairs, I
think it could have happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It could,&#8221; replied Mr. Scanlon.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are a number of little things which
Mr. Scanlon could not understand,&#8221; said the
crime specialist to the girl. &#8220;For example, how
he came to see you in the hall, apparently looking
for some one, on the night he discovered the
housebreakers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He saw me?&#8221; She looked at Scanlon.
&#8220;When?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you lighted the match. But I heard
you before that&mdash;talking to the fellow who jumped
through the window.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You heard me talking to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; the girl was
amazed; then a sudden thought seemed to come
to her, and she stopped. &#8220;And then,&#8221; she said,
searching Scanlon&#8217;s face, &#8220;what did I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You went away,&#8221; replied the big man. &#8220;I
heard you go down the hall. But you came back,
and it was then you struck the match.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s golden head shook slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not go away and return,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I heard&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The first woman you heard was not I!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was now Mr. Scanlon&#8217;s turn to stare.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Knowles,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to
think I&#8217;m trying to put anything at your door
that shouldn&#8217;t be there. But you expected something
to happen that night&mdash;I saw it in your face
in the afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl did not reply for a moment; she looked
at him, steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I know what you mean,&#8221; she said, at
last. &#8220;It was when you spoke of Mr. Ashton-Kirk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
coming that night. I was frightened then,
as I was frightened a while ago when I was asked
to await him here. I felt sure that if he were
expected something was about to happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Scanlon frowned.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said he, &#8220;these are queer times,
and when a fellow get mixed up in such, and sees
things that he don&#8217;t fathom, about the only way
open to him is to ask to have them explained.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can understand that feeling very
well,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There are many things for
which I too have sought an explanation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you left the room that night of the
burglar&#8217;s visit,&#8221; said Bat, &#8220;and while I was telling
Campe and his man what had happened, you did
it very quietly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had a reason,&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;I hurried
away to find the person whom I&#8217;d been seeking
when you saw me strike the match.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, were you successful?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was. I saw who opened the gate and liberated
your prisoner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Scanlon mopped his face, which had grown
suddenly heated.</p>

<p>&#8220;The wind&#8217;s changing,&#8221; said he to the crime
specialist. &#8220;It&#8217;s beginning to blow from a new
quarter altogether.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ashton-Kirk was looking at the girl.
&#8220;You see how it is?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;And now that I do, I
think it very strange that it did not occur to me
before. But I was so full of the thought of helping
Mr. Campe, even though he did treat me like
a child and refused to confide in me, that I never
dreamed any one might suspect me of being one of
those who were threatening him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>She turned to Scanlon.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought all the time that you would understand.
That is why I hinted at this and that, and
called your attention in an indirect way to those
things which excited my suspicions.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, oh,&#8221; with a gesture, &#8220;there were so
many of them. I suspected the people at the
inn from the beginning because I once saw a
crippled man there who had been a friend of Mr.
Campe&#8217;s father in Mexico, and who afterward,
for some reason, became his enemy. The strange
footprints which I&#8217;d see of a morning upon the
river bank put dread into my heart, and the
stealthy figures that I&#8217;d see there sometimes of a
night, as I looked from my window, filled me
with fear. I then began to suspect a traitor in
Schwartzberg, and took to searching and prying
and listening; and on the night when I found
the door to the vault standing open and saw a
stranger ascending the stairs, I felt sure of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was that the night that Mrs. Kretz shut the
door, and there was a pistol shot, and you cried
out?&#8221; asked Bat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Miss Knowles. &#8220;But,&#8221; she
went on, &#8220;I think I had other reasons to be suspicious.
As you say, Mr. Scanlon, these are queer
times. Things here are odd&mdash;strange; like yourself,
I do not understand them. What is there
about this harp,&#8221; and she laid her hand upon the
instrument, &#8220;which attracts me so strongly&mdash;for
what purpose is it being used other than the
melody a player it could strike from its strings?
Take that great blade upon the wall,&#8221; here she
turned her face toward the two-handed sword
resting against the strip of tapestry between the
windows. &#8220;It seems evident enough&mdash;there does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
not look to be anything about it of a secret nature.
And yet there is! But I don&#8217;t know what, though
I have tried to discover many and many times;
and I have stolen it away to my room more than
once. But it was no use.&#8221; There was a short
silence, then she went on, to Scanlon: &#8220;On the
night that you followed Mr. Campe and me out
along the path, and you told the story of the
officer whose sword trailed upon the ground, I felt
sure that you had discovered something about
this weapon, and were, perhaps, trying to convey
it to me secretly. But I saw afterward that this
was not so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; said Scanlon, who felt much as if
the floor were slipping from under his feet, &#8220;what
was the idea of the walk on that night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Campe was depressed; his spirit was
sinking; he shook with fear of what was outside.
I knew that facing a danger was tonic, while
cowering at the mental picture of it was spirit-killing.
So I thought it would do him good if he
went out, voluntarily, if only for a few moments&mdash;no
matter what the danger. Of course he did not
understand why I wanted him to go; neither did
Kretz, who protested very strongly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat looked at the crime specialist, who smiled
in an amused sort of way; then he said to the
girl:</p>

<p>&#8220;You say you took the sword to your room to
examine it? How about the harp? Ever take
that away with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; replied Miss Knowles. &#8220;Some
nights ago I secreted it on the floor above, and
when everything was quiet I went there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You sat in an alcove behind some curtains,&#8221;
said Bat. &#8220;It was dark. The window was open.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
You picked at the strings of the harp, but made
no sound.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw me?&#8221; the girl seemed startled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did. What were you doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I had seen done more than once before.
And I was trying to understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more Scanlon looked toward Ashton-Kirk,
and now that gentleman spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;This interest in Schwartzberg as to the location
of the wind of an evening. You noticed it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; The girl&#8217;s blue eyes went to the
speaker, full of interest. &#8220;But, like the other
things, I could never understand it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw some one strike the harp strings at
night at an open window; was it always the same
window?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It depended upon the direction of the wind&mdash;the
window selected always opened in the direction
from which the breeze was blowing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did that not suggest something to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It did. A signal. But,&#8221; with a gesture, &#8220;it
could not have been. There was no sound.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk turned to the harp; his long supple
fingers ran over the strings, and they responded
stirringly. Bat Scanlon leaned toward Miss
Knowles.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got just one more
question to ask you, and here it is: What about
that package that came the other day&mdash;the one
with the blank paper in it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know!&#8221; The girl seemed weary
with the things which she did not understand.
&#8220;It was like the other packages that came here.
Always blank paper; never a single thing which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
would lead me to even guess at what they
meant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you saw the man Alva in the moonlight,&#8221;
spoke Ashton-Kirk, addressing Scanlon,
his fingers still gently plucking at the harp strings,
&#8220;did you pay particular attention to the hill
he had selected?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a high one,&#8221; said Bat. &#8220;But I think
that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was another advantage,&#8221; said the
special detective. &#8220;There were no intervening
trees. From that hilltop to Schwartzberg there
is one clear sweep.&#8221;</p>

<p>He ceased strumming at the harp and his eyes
went toward the sword upon the wall. A step or
two, and he had it in his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;It brought fortune to the Hohenlos, eh?&#8221;
said he, and his eyes seemed dreamy as he gazed
at it. &#8220;A good blade!&#8221; Then the eyes lifted,
and he continued: &#8220;Those strings, Scanlon,
where are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; said the big man, taking the tangled
mass from his coat pocket, and offering it to the
other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull one out. That&#8217;s it. Thanks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk took the proffered string; it was
quite long, and trailed upon the floor in a soiled
heap. Starting at a point close to the hilt, he
began wrapping the string around the sword
blade.</p>

<p>The big man watched his friend narrowly as he
worked with the string and the sword blade. He
felt that in this, queer as the proceeding seemed,
there was to be an explanation of some things
that had gone before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kirk&#8217;s the fellow to explain them,&#8221; he told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
himself, as he watched. &#8220;He&#8217;s never in a hurry
to do it, of course; and maybe that&#8217;s the reason
why he never makes a mistake. But explain
them he does; and don&#8217;t let that get away from
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Knowles was also intensely interested;
she followed the fingers of the special detective
with the utmost attention. Carefully Ashton-Kirk
wrapped the string about the great blade.
Often he paused and inspected what he had done,
as though to make sure that it was what he
wanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;The romance which might attach to a weapon
of this sort,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is endless.&#8221; Slowly he
worked, and carefully. Every moment or two he
paused and surveyed what he had done. &#8220;For
history, poetry, drama, all tell us that such blades
were forged when romance was thick upon every
hand. What backs has it hung across in journeys
through strange lands? What strong hands have
clasped its hilt as the desert&#8217;s dust showed the
cohorts of the infidel? What scaling ladders has
it mounted? What castle walls has it topped?
What helmets and plates of proof has it rung
upon? What captive damsels has it freed?
What number of the oppressed and helpless has
its hiss and its swing released from tyranny?
What stout squires have ridden behind its owner?
What brawny lanz-knechts have cheered to see it
flash, and have pressed after it into the heat of
the fight?</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; continued the crime specialist, &#8220;to
what base uses has it come. From being the
weapon of a hero, it becomes the means of one
criminal communicating with another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Scanlon.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>&#8220;Look!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk held the sword, hilt up, and with
the flat of it toward them. To the amazement of
the big man, he saw lettered in black ink, down
the length of the closely wrapped string:</p>

<p class="center">

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />


<small>IN WHICH A MATTER OF MUCH INGENUITY IS
CONSIDERED</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;HELLO!&#8221; said Bat, his eyes almost
bulging at the sight. &#8220;What the
dickens is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>For answer the crime specialist unwound the
string, drew another from the many in Scanlon&#8217;s
hands, and wrapped it around the blade in turn.
Once more he held up the weapon and now they
read:</p>

<p class="center">
T<br />
O<br />
N<br />
I<br />
G<br />
H<br />
T<br />
</p>

<p>&#8220;I get it,&#8221; said the big man, &#8220;not all, but
some. Those packages sent Miss Hohenlo had
nothing at all that was worth looking at <i>inside</i>;
it was <i>outside</i> that their interest lay. In the
string.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said the girl, wonderingly, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
heard of some such a thing as this before. But it
never occurred to me to apply it in this case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alva has a wooden sword the exact shape and
dimensions of this,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk, tapping the
weapon. &#8220;When he desired to send a message to
his confederate in Schwartzberg he&#8217;d wrap a
string about the stick and carefully ink his communication,
letter after letter, down its length.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
After this he&#8217;d unwind the cord, tie it about a
parcel of blank paper and dispatch it. There was
nothing about it that would excite suspicion; it
held its secret until wrapped around the blade of
the sword; then bit by bit the inked portion fell
into place, forming the letters, and the writing
was read.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All these strings are messages then,&#8221; said
Scanlon. He frowned perplexedly, and asked:
&#8220;But why write this way? Why not a letter,
and a cipher inside?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The letter might, in some way, be opened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it couldn&#8217;t be read.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not; nevertheless a cipher writing
would attract notice, and in the face of such
happenings as Schwartzberg has been experiencing,
suspicion would be sure to follow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Bat. Then with a nod at
the strings: &#8220;Going to read them all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk. &#8220;It is hardly worth
while.&#8221; He threw the heavy sword upon a table
and crossed to the harp once more. &#8220;They must
be very brief, and little could be got from them
at best. They, for the most part, merely
appointed a time for the real communications.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The real ones!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and those were received and answered
upon the strings of the harp.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scanlon gazed at the girl, and then his eyes
went wonderingly back to the other. Miss
Knowles took an eager forward step.</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon my first visit,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk, &#8220;I
knew that you were calling my attention urgently
to this instrument. And, in consequence, I took
especial interest in it. I noted some peculiarities,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
but I did not form any conclusions until after I&#8217;d
had Scanlon&#8217;s report of what he&#8217;d witnessed, and
had another and specialized examination of its
parts a while ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;The harp,&#8221; he went on, glancing at his two
hearers, &#8220;is not, as a rule, a powerfully made
thing. This is especially so in the case of those of
this small size. The wood and the metal that go
into its construction are light.&#8221; His keen glance
now fixed itself upon Miss Knowles, and he asked:
&#8220;Do you know whether this instrument has been
sent away at any time recently for repairs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has. Shortly after we came here,&#8221; she
answered. &#8220;Something was broken, I understood.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;The gilding is much newer in some places
than it is in others,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It&#8217;s the sign of
the repairer of anything that he never does all
over a job with his finishing tool, merely touching
up the parts he&#8217;s worked upon.</p>

<p>&#8220;More than likely,&#8221; he went on, his eyes now
upon the harp, &#8220;the sending of the instrument
away was for a reason altogether different from
the one given out. For in those parts where the
tinker&#8217;s hand is plainest, I find that some very important
and unusual departures have been made.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The upper strings are odd,&#8221; said the girl,
eagerly. &#8220;I often noticed them. They are of
metal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And very heavy&mdash;of steel I should say; and
they are strung to an astonishing tension&mdash;infinitely
higher than the customary strings of the
harp. The &#8216;pull&#8217; of a number of steel strings of
this thickness, and keyed to this pitch, would be
too much for a frame of the ordinary sort. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
would be pulled asunder. Consequently this one
has been powerfully re-inforced; the keys are
of a special type, and the sockets in which they
turn appear marvellously strong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why all this?&#8221; asked Scanlon, his frowning
gaze upon the harp.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was found necessary to establish a means of
communication between the inside of Schwartzberg
and the outside. Letters or written messages
would not do; signal lights might be seen;
secret meetings were almost impossible, for one
could not often steal successfully in and out of a
place watched as this one is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; agreed Scanlon, &#8220;it couldn&#8217;t be depended
on. And neither could the vaults be used
as a meeting place. For the door to them is the
most watched thing in the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A way must be had,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk, &#8220;and
one that must be silent and secret. This man,
Alva, as Fuller&#8217;s report tells, is an able physicist,
and so the method hit upon of bridging this difficulty
must be his.&#8221; He looked at them as though
asking their particular attention. &#8220;The eye,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;is capable of vision only up to a certain
point. It will follow an object going up into the
air; then the object will disappear; it is &#8216;out of
sight.&#8217; However, though the object can&#8217;t be seen,
it is still there, still going upward.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve heard the yell of the siren, a thing
used upon the seagoing ships?&#8221; he proceeded.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve heard its shriek mount and mount, getting
higher and higher, and finally you ceased to
hear it? But it had not stopped. It was still
going on, only it had reached a pitch so high that
it was out of ear-shot. It was only when it began
to fall and had reached the point where you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
had lost it, that you began to hear it once
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Scanlon drew down one corner of his mouth
and blinked a great number of times.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you know about that!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps the world&#8217;s greatest authority upon
sound,&#8221; Ashton-Kirk went on as he took some
notes from his pocket-book, &#8220;is the German,
Helmholtz. In his book &#8216;On the Sensations of
Tone&#8217; he says:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The simple partial tones contained in a composite
mass of musical tones produce peculiar
mechanical effects in nature, altogether independent
of the human ear and its sensations, and altogether
independent of merely theoretical considerations.
These effects consequently give a
peculiar objective significance to this peculiar
method of analyzing vibrational forms.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; continued Ashton-Kirk, &#8220;this master
of sound goes on to speak of the phenomenon of
sympathetic resonance. He says on this point:
&#8216;When, for example, the strings of two violins are
in exact unison, and one string is bowed, the other
will begin to vibrate.&#8217; And in another place:
&#8216;Gently touch one of the keys of a pianoforte
without striking the string, so as to raise the
damper only, and then sing a note of the corresponding
pitch, forcibly directing the voice against
the strings of the instrument. On ceasing to sing
the note will be echoed back from the piano. It
is easy to discover that this echo is caused by the
string which is in unison with the note, for directly
the hand is removed from the key, and the damper
is allowed to fall, the echo ceases.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;We see, in the case of the siren, and in other
things, that some tones are so high that they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
not heard. Also we see, by Helmholtz, that
when a string keyed to a certain tone is struck,
another string, keyed to the same tone, will at
once take up the sound, or vibration&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Miss Knowles interrupted him, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I see what you mean,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;These unusual strings upon the harp, this great
strengthening of the frame, means that it is keyed
to this inaudible pitch. That some one outside
has an instrument of some sort keyed in unison;
and when the harp string is touched, the other
vibrated in sympathy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that these vibrations, made in long or
short waves, or in groups, much, perhaps, as the
telegraph code is made, formed a ready means of
communication.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Scanlon seemed appalled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, after a short pause, &#8220;I think
I&#8217;ve absorbed the most of it. But I&#8217;m not sure.
However, there is one thing I <i>am</i> sure of, and that
is that I&#8217;ve got a cabinet sized photograph of the
party who&#8217;s got the other instrument. That&#8217;s what
Alva had that night on the hilltop when I saw
him sitting in the moonlight. He was exchanging
silent talk with Schwartzberg.&#8221; Then an idea
seemed to strike him, and he frowned again.
&#8220;There is one thing that I don&#8217;t quite get. And
that is: If these vibrations, or tones, or sounds,
whatever you call them, were too high to be heard,
how did the receivers of them make them out?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;As to that,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I am not prepared to
say just now. A further search into the thing
might bring it out, but I&#8217;m not sure. But this I
will say: The sense of touch is marvellously
sensitive in some people; one every now and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
then hears some wonderful story with regard to
it. Fine, delicate hands may be the answer to
your question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Another thing,&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;Why was the
wind required to always be from the direction of
the person sending the vibrations to Schwartzberg?
You&#8217;ll say to carry them. But what of the
answer to them? Would not the wind which
carried the vibrations from one quarter hold back
those sent from the one opposite?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only in part, unless the wind was very strong.
And I think if you can remember the nights upon
which this means of communication was used,
they were fairly calm. The fact that the wind at
the time of the signals was always from the direction
of the person outside might be explained by
that person&#8217;s superior knowledge of the medium in
use. Having a more perfect understanding of it,
he was the more able to read its fainter manifestations.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here a small clock hurriedly struck the hour of
nine. And Ashton-Kirk looked at Scanlon.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I think it&#8217;s time to
drop speculation for a space. There is some work
ahead of us which is going to be sharp and of the
sort that leaves not even a trace of doubt in the
mind.&#8221;</p>

<small>CONCLUSION</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ASHTON-KIRK, with Miss Knowles and
Scanlon, entered the billiard room a few
moments later.</p>

<p>Miss Hohenlo greeted them despairingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Frederic&#8217;s game is disgraceful,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
never saw him play so badly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; laughed Ashton-Kirk, &#8220;it will
be a charity to relieve you of him. Miss Knowles,
I am sure, will take his place with credit.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl gave him a quick glance; then she went
to the table and took the cue from Campe&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I have much of a chance against
Miss Hohenlo,&#8221; smiled she. &#8220;She&#8217;s always been
too clever for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; cried the spinster, reproachfully,
&#8220;you play an excellent game. Indeed, I am
never quite at ease with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That maiden-lady&#8217;s pretty able,&#8221; spoke Scanlon
to Ashton-Kirk, a few moments later in the
hall; &#8220;and in other things besides billiards. She
must be on that something&#8217;s happening, that you
first put Campe on guard over her and now the
girl, and yet she goes on as if nothing was to be
feared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Calmness in the face of danger usually comes
from a lack of imagination,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; protested Scanlon, &#8220;you wouldn&#8217;t say
she had any shortcoming like that, would you?
I think the way she switched the matter of the
northwest wind on to the shoulders of the girl
is a good proof that she&#8217;s all there in that respect.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
And the way she grabbed, that same night, the
fact that the sword was missing, and pieced the
fact on to my suspicions of Miss Knowles, and the
same weapon was rather cute.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Campe came out of the billiard room and
joined them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What now?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk, &#8220;the last act of
this drama of yours is about to be played.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said Campe, his eyes burning.
&#8220;Whatever it develops&mdash;good!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you armed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I always am&mdash;now,&#8221; answered the young man,
sadly. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t taken a step without a firearm
in readiness for months.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you, Scanlon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; replied the big man.</p>

<p>When they reached the lower floor, Ashton-Kirk
said to Campe:</p>

<p>&#8220;Please call your man. We&#8217;ll need him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; Mr. Scanlon held out one large protesting
hand. &#8220;What do you want him to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going into the cellars. I think it best
that some one be left to watch the hall thereabouts,
and the cellar stairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bat nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thought it was something like that,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;And that&#8217;s why I wanted to know. Now I
want to say this. Kretz may be all right; then,
again, he may not be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Campe gazed at the speaker astonished.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should as soon distrust myself as Kretz,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;I&#8217;ve known him for years, and he is in
every way worthy of confidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May be so,&#8221; admitted Bat. &#8220;May be so. But
things break the other way sometimes, you know.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
So let&#8217;s be sure.&#8221; He looked at the others inquiringly.
&#8220;How about that day when we were
shot at in the cellar?&#8221; said he. &#8220;How did the
lamp come to smash? It happened, remember,
before a shot was fired.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s all you have against the sergeant-major,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;I think he will do. As it
happens, I know just what caused the smash;
some one from the darkness struck it. I saw the
hand that did it, but not the owner thereof.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scanlon was silent for a moment; then he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t set myself up as a judge. I was
wrong in some other matters, so there&#8217;s no reason
why I shouldn&#8217;t be wrong in this one of Kretz&#8217;s.
So, if <i>you</i> think he&#8217;s O.K., I&#8217;m willing to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is only one traitor in Schwartzberg,&#8221;
said young Campe, mournfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Scanlon.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you know,&#8221; replied the young man.
&#8220;And, as I said to you before, there&#8217;s no need to
mention names.&#8221; There was a brief silence, then
he added: &#8220;Something made me suspect that
everything was not right. But I was never sure
of anything,&#8221; to Ashton-Kirk, &#8220;until the night
before your first visit here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw some one picked up by the searchlight
while Kretz was firing at a man who was
running away,&#8221; said the crime specialist. &#8220;We
saw her, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When she returned,&#8221; said Campe in a low
tone, &#8220;I asked her why she went, how she got
out, and what was her errand. But she couldn&#8217;t
answer. And ever since she has avoided the
subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I made one of my customary mistakes that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
night, too,&#8221; said Scanlon. &#8220;I picked the wrong
lady, and I thought you meant her, too.&#8221; Then
to Ashton-Kirk: &#8220;Shall I call the sergeant-major
in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Ashton-Kirk.</p>

<p>In a few moments the German entered, and he
listened, grim and unwinking, to the detective&#8217;s
instructions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here I shall stand,&#8221; said he, &#8220;until you tell
me&mdash;no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough&mdash;if you keep your eyes open.&#8221;
Then to Scanlon Ashton-Kirk said: &#8220;Do you
think you could find a hatchet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have one in a minute,&#8221; replied the big
man.</p>

<p>He produced one from the storeroom. Ashton-Kirk
then went to the outer gate and blew a
shrill signal. Almost at once Burgess and his
companion appeared out of the darkness, and
followed the special detective into the castle.
Then the electric torch flashed along the vault
steps as the five descended. The door closed and
Kretz was heard to shoot the heavy bolts.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather early to expect anything definite,&#8221;
said the crime specialist. &#8220;But you&#8217;d better see
that your weapons are ready, for all that.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when they reached the floor of the vault
each had a heavy automatic in his hand. Quickly
they went through the place and found it empty.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one here,&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon, fingering the
grip of his weapon regretfully. Then in another
tone he added, to Ashton-Kirk: &#8220;But, I say, what
makes you think there will be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some days ago,&#8221; replied the special detective,
&#8220;in my journeying about in the guise of an
invalid, I came across a boat hidden along the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
river bank, and the indications were very strong
that it belonged to the people at the inn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; asked Scanlon.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you told me of your experience with
the man who went through Mr. Campe&#8217;s papers,&#8221;
said Ashton-Kirk, &#8220;I thought a paper was the
object of the visit. And so it was&mdash;but only as
a thing that would lead to something else. This
latter fact I suspected from the contents of the
telegram received by me this morning; and I was
convinced of it when we made our search of the
vaults a few hours ago. The paper sought was
one which held certain directions; the man with
the cough found it that night before he leaped
through the window. The paper could not have
been clear to them; it pointed to something
hidden here in the vaults of Schwartzberg; they
searched, but without success. At length, perhaps
last night, Alva came, as we saw by the
wheel tracks of his chair. His superior intelligence
at once showed itself, and located what
they sought.&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Campe gave a cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;So it was in Schwartzberg, as they said!&#8221; he
exclaimed, despairingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You never knew it, then?&#8221; asked Ashton-Kirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew nothing, except that I was threatened
with death unless I gave up what I had never seen
and knew nothing of. I told them so a hundred
times, but they would not believe me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could have given them the run of the
place,&#8221; suggested Ashton-Kirk, &#8220;and let them
search for themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>The jaw of the young man set.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he. &#8220;They asked that, but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
refused. You, I think,&#8221; and he looked at the
other steadily, &#8220;know why.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I do,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; spoke Mr. Scanlon, &#8220;tell me how you
know they located what they were after?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that far corner,&#8221; said the crime specialist,
&#8220;there is a heavy flag, set in the floor. Very
recently, so I noted to-day, some one has scraped
away the cement at its edges. There has been an
effort to raise it, but the attempt has failed
because of a lack of tools.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got it,&#8221; said Bat. &#8220;When you walked
me up along the river this afternoon, that place
where you left me to go poking among the tangled
old vine was the place where you discovered the
boat. And you saw tools in it; and that&#8217;s what
told you they were coming to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well done,&#8221; laughed-the detective. &#8220;Very
well done indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Campe, who had patiently kept himself
from asking questions, seemed unable to contain
himself any longer. One query followed another
in rapid succession, and in a few moments Ashton-Kirk
found himself deep in statements and
explanations. The torch had been snapped off;
they stood in the darkness of the vaults, talking
in low tones.</p>

<p>And when everything had been told him, the
young man was silent for a space. Then he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The way you have gone about this is quite
wonderful&mdash;I would not have believed that such
a meagre array of detached facts could be so
pieced together, and made into a whole so direct
and significant. But even now I do not understand
how you made up your mind as to the
nature of the thing these men seek.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>&#8220;When I read Fuller&#8217;s statement, contained in
his report, that the former head of the Guatemala
police was now that country&#8217;s representative at
Washington, I wired at once asking information
as to the man Evans and the nature of his offences
in Guatemala. The telegram I received this
morning,&#8221; to Scanlon, &#8220;was in answer to that,
and it said&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the voice died away; there was silence for
a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; asked Scanlon, &#8220;what did it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again there was silence. Then, little by little,
a sound reached the ears of the big man&mdash;a faint
scraping&mdash;and then a murmur.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are coming,&#8221; said the crime specialist.
&#8220;This way.&#8221;</p>

<p>For an instant the torch flashed to show them
their way; then, safe in the shadows, they waited.
A glimmer of light danced in the darkness, then
it flooded a narrow space; the door to the underground
passage had been opened; a man stepped
into the vault. To the surprise of Scanlon he
recognized the soft gentleman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; was Bat&#8217;s mental exclamation.
&#8220;He&#8217;s here again, is he? Maybe we&#8217;ll play a
return engagement; our act went big last
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The newcomer looked carefully about and as he
was doing so a second man entered. This was
the drawn man, Shaw. He turned and helped
the Indian servant with the rolling chair, in which
lay Alva. After this came Hirst, who had discarded
both his crutch and stick, and then the
landlord of the inn, with the peppery little doctor
carrying some heavy tools.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>&#8220;What is the time?&#8221; asked Alva in his strong
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Almost ten,&#8221; replied the soft man.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better get to work at once,&#8221; spoke Alva.
&#8220;Get the bars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; said the soft man. &#8220;I want to have a
look at the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rays of the lantern came creeping toward
the five crouching in the shadow. But the edge
of the illumination did not quite reach them as the
man went by and softly up the step. After a little
he returned; the rays lighted up the inquiring
faces of those awaiting him.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he reported. &#8220;It seems to be still
nailed fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Alva, impatiently, &#8220;to work.
And let us get out of this hole. I can feel the
dampness creeping into my very bones.&#8221;</p>

<p>The watchers saw them cluster about the point
indicated by Ashton-Kirk a short time before.
The yellow light of the lantern played about them
quaveringly; Alva, with his misshapen head and
his burning eyes, sat propped up in his chair,
waiting.</p>

<p>Iron chinked against stone; there came a
grinding and a straining as the men threw their
weights on the bars; then followed a panting of
breath, muffled exclamations, and a huge slab
of stone from the floor leaned against the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;The light!&#8221; cried Shaw.</p>

<p>The rays shone down on the place which the
flag had covered a few moments before.</p>

<p>&#8220;There they are!&#8221; came the smothered cry of
the soft man.</p>

<p>Shaw snatched at something; in a moment it
was out upon the floor. It was a flat package,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
wrapped in lead foil and tied with cord. A knife-blade
cut the binding, the foil was torn away, as
was layer after layer of oiled paper; then the rays
of the lantern glanced upon the surface of a number
of metal plates.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are the plates! It&#8217;s Joe&#8217;s work!&#8221;
The soft man was exultant and waved his arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many are there?&#8221; asked Alva.</p>

<p>&#8220;Four,&#8221; replied Shaw. &#8220;And all in perfect
condition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In six months,&#8221; babbled the soft man, &#8220;there
will be some &#8216;stuff&#8217; in circulation in Mexico that
will never be detected. &#8216;Stuff,&#8217;&#8221; and here he
laughed almost hysterically, &#8220;that&#8217;ll be better
than the genuine. Joe was the workman; he knew
how to go over a plate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he also knew how to wrap one so that
the damp wouldn&#8217;t get a chance to work on it,&#8221;
said Shaw. &#8220;Hold the lantern closer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Under the light the drawn man inspected the
plates closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great work!&#8221; said he, at length. &#8220;Never
saw better.&#8221; Then he looked at the soft man.
&#8220;How long did your brother put in on them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure. A good many months, though.
And it was all done in this place. Joe worked
himself to death over them, he was sick when old
Campe got cold feet, backed out of the job and
hurried north. He must have given Joe some
kind of a story to get him to hide his work in this
way; he was a wise old fox, as you know. Anyway,
he went back to Mexico; Joe died before he
could get any kind of word to me; and there we
were, up a tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we are safely down again,&#8221; came the
strong voice of the cripple; &#8220;but don&#8217;t let us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
wait here. Get the plates together, and we&#8217;ll be
off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shaw obeyed; carefully he placed the plates
one upon another, the layers of oiled paper between.
He had them all nicely adjusted when
they were snatched from his hand, and a voice
said quietly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Careful now, gentlemen. Don&#8217;t do anything
hasty. There are five guns between you and
what you want.&#8221;</p>

<p>Startled, amazed, snarling, the seven stared at
Ashton-Kirk. Faintly they saw the burly form of
Scanlon in the shadow, and beside him the master
of Schwartzberg and the two detectives; in the
polish of the black automatics which these held
there was a silent menace.</p>

<p>Ashton-Kirk nodded to the soft man, and
smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Guatemala police also admired the work
of your brother,&#8221; said he. &#8220;They say they never
saw better.&#8221; Then without turning his head:
&#8220;Scanlon!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right here,&#8221; answered the big man, promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long do you think it would take you to
undo the work of Joe Evans, engraver, upon four
plates, counterfeiting the notes of the Mexican
Republic?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With a hatchet,&#8221; replied the big man, &#8220;about
once second to each plate.&#8221;</p>

<p>The engraved steel clashed upon the floor at
his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take the torch, too,&#8221; said Bat, &#8220;so&#8217;s to be
sure and make a job of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady now,&#8221; said the detective, as his keen
eye noted a movement on the part of the criminals.
&#8220;And you, Mr. Shaw, keep away from that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
lantern. I understand the sudden extinguishing
of lights is a specialty of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>The light of the torch fell upon the four steel
plates; Mr. Scanlon placed them face up, and
with a few sharp cuts from the edge of the hatchet
upon each ruined them for ever. And then, once
more, they clashed upon the floor, this time at the
feet of the intruders.</p>

<p>&#8220;There they are,&#8221; observed the big man, lazily.
&#8220;Seeing that you were at so much trouble to get
them I&#8217;d hate to see you go without them&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; said Alva, and his full lips drew
back and showed his teeth in a smile, &#8220;you will
now call the police.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly think we&#8217;ll go to that extreme,&#8221;
replied Ashton-Kirk. &#8220;The Mexican government
possibly would be interested to know who was
guilty of the murder of three members of the
Campe family, but we&#8217;ll hold that in reserve for a
while, at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t prove anything,&#8221; sneered
Alva.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too sure of that, Mr. Alva. The
mark of your hand is plain in your work, and it
would not be at all difficult to tie you up in it.&#8221;
He nodded to the man, quietly. &#8220;But,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;we&#8217;ll say nothing about that now. I&#8217;m giving
you a chance&mdash;not for your sake, nor for the sake
of any of your friends, of course&mdash;but to spare an
entirely innocent young man a family scandal.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pointed to the underground passage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Waste no time in going,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And let
us see no more of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sullenly the seven, like wild beasts, longing,
but not daring to leap upon their captors, turned
to the passage. Alva&#8217;s chair was rolled into it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
then the other followed, muttering and with many
sidelong glances.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; called Scanlon into the tunnel.
&#8220;Hope you&#8217;ve had a good time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the great stone swung shut and closed
them out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll ever be bothered by any
of those gentlemen again,&#8221; said Ashton-Kirk, to
Campe. &#8220;They were interested in the plates,
and not at all in you. However,&#8221; as they
ascended the steps, &#8220;I&#8217;d have that passage filled
in, if I were you, and meant to spend much time at
Schwartzberg.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kretz opened the door at Campe&#8217;s summons.
The entire household seemed gathered in the
lower hall about the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Fr&auml;ulein Hohenlo,&#8221; and the grim German
motioned toward that lady, &#8220;would go down to
you. But I would not let her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not hurt?&#8221; asked a voice, and the
golden-haired girl came forward toward young
Campe. Her voice was low and trembling, and
she moved unsteadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care!&#8221; cried Ashton-Kirk, sharply. He
was not a moment too soon in the warning, for
Campe had barely time to leap forward and catch
the fainting girl in his arms.</p>

<p>Miss Hohenlo, white, and with a deadened look
in her eyes stood looking at Ashton-Kirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was not injured?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alva.&#8221; Then, quietly, for she seemed to
understand that all was over, &#8220;He is my husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Ashton-Kirk. &#8220;He is safe
enough.&#8221; Then looking at the woman with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
narrowing eyes, he continued: &#8220;He has just
about reached the river bank. Will you join him
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dumbly she went down the hall, her hands
seeming to grope the way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kretz,&#8221; said the special detective, &#8220;open the
door.&#8221;</p>

<p>The German moved after the woman, and in a
few moments they heard the great gate open and
close.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mr. Scanlon, with a long breath,
&#8220;that&#8217;s all finished! And it seems to me,&#8221;
nodding to Ashton-Kirk, affably, &#8220;it&#8217;s a pretty
fair kind of a job.&#8221;</p>

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
